I've been a little more excited for this Friday than a normal Friday. (See #1) It's here and my husband took the day off! Looking forward to a nice relaxing day and finally getting to run outside!  
  
Now for my Five on Friday:  
  
\[1\]  
My husband was away for work this week and so I got a little taste of being a single mother. The girls were sick and so we didn't go out for many of our normal activities but overall we had a great week. We were all very excited to see Daddy's face last night at the airport!

I ran every single day that my husband was gone. It was the thing I did for myself and I needed to make it work. We bought a video monitor so that I could run while Little E slept. It was well worth the expense!

I love watching Little E crawl. She just learned last week and she's just the cutest little timid crawler. Here's a short clip to check out the crawling in action.

I'm racing on Sunday! I'm running in our local Girls on the Run 5K. I haven't really talked about it much but (after my recent half) I've been following the tail end of a Hal Higdon plan to get ready. I ran this race [**last year**](http://amotherspace.blogspot.com/2012/11/girls-on-run-5k-race-recap.html#.UoUsnPlQEYk) when I was pregnant so I can't wait to run it again this weekend. Oh, and we signed the kids up for the 1K too!

My 10-year-old niece is beginning the process of a bone marrow transplant. She's the bravest girl I know and I wish she didn't have to go through this. In honor of Reese I want to encourage you to get on the bone marrow registry. It's easy to order a kit or find a local event in your area. Check out [bethematch.org](http://bethematch.org/). You could save a life!
