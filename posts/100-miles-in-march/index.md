I set out in March with the goal of completing 100 running miles. All the miles were specifically in my training plan but when I saw that FitFluential was holding a #ffmarchmiles challenge to run 100 miles I had to play along. I thought it would be fun to officially keep track after each run instead of weekly like I normally do.

To join in on the challenge, I posted all of my workouts on Instagram and posted how far along I was in my mileage. I hit 100 early this week and kept running to hit 128.52 miles for the month so far. I have a few more miles to log today to cap off the month.

It's my highest mileage month in awhile and it feels good. I like the longer 5 and 6 mile runs during the week and I also am enjoying that only 1 or maybe 2 runs a week are around 3 miles.

My long run this past weekend was 13 miles. It worked out better for my family to run in the afternoon on Saturday instead of in the morning. I put Little A down for her nap and I headed out while my husband stayed home with the littles. It was a beautiful spring afternoon. The temps were in the mid 60's and the wind was manageable. It should have been a perfect run.

I was seriously lacking energy even before starting this run, which didn't help things. My long run goal range is between 9:30 and 10:50 (according to the [McMillan Running Calculator](http://www.mcmillanrunning.com/index.php/site/calculator)) but I would really like to keep it closer to the 9:30 side. I finished this run with a 10:09 average pace (with a strong finish) but most of the run I was hanging on to a 10:17 pace.

That 10:17 pace felt so hard and it just makes me doubt that I can finish my upcoming half with a 9:05 pace. I'm counting on the fact that this was just a difficult training run and the adrenaline of running in a race will help me achieve what I have been working towards.

Mileage for Saturday is off this week. I actually ran 13.25 miles but my GPS stopped at 12.87 for some strange reason.
