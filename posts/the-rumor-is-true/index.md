A Friday Five that is completely about running! I'm jumping right in today.

  

\[one\]

Yesterday, the news was announced that the Chicago Marathon was moving to a [lottery system](http://www.chicagomarathon.com/participant-information/registration/) this year. I'm more than a little disappointed because this was/is my goal race of the year. My sister lives in Chicago so it's an easier race for me for traveling purposes and I was just plain excited to run in a city that I love. I'm using the past tense already! I still have hope. I'm hoping to be one of the 45,000 people running the streets of Chicago on October 12th.

I recently decided that it's o.k. that I don't like running alone in the dark. I live in a nice neighborhood and I have nothing specific to worry about but I'm just not comfortable out all by myself. Why would I do something I love but not be comfortable? So, I'm running inside and I don't even look at the weather anymore to help make that decision. It does make the outside weekend runs all the more special, for sure.

I'm getting tired of the treadmill. Don't get me wrong, I'm so happy that I have it and I'm able to still run early in the morning before the day officially starts. But I'm ready to run outside again. I can't wait for the early morning light again.

That 'stop' button is all too easy to push on the treadmill but one way I'm getting around it is by adding in strength training in between the miles. Run a mile or two, jump off and do 10 minutes of weights and strength, jump back on for another mile. Jump off and do some more strength. It's definitely a win win because I'm fitting in my strength and the miles aren't as long.

Back to the Chicago Marathon again. If I don't get in, I still want to run a marathon in the fall. I can fall back on my local race, the Prairie Fire Marathon, which is a great race but I've already ran it before. So, do I pick another 'vacation' race or stick close to home? Decisions, decisions.

  

**Were you planning on registering for the Chicago Marathon? Have the new registration requirements/lottery system changed your mind? What is your back up race?**
