Here is try number 2 at writing a blog. My main reasons for starting up Mom on the Run is to keep all my race results together, track runs and training and just to look back on my running history and how it interacts with my family life. Even though it is out there for everyone to see it is mainly just for me. I love reading other running blogs and I've been inspired to start my own.
