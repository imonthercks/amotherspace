Five things on my mind this week.  

  
I finally gave in and made overnight oats. I've been looking at recipes _forever_ but I couldn't get over the fact that they are cold when you eat them. I like my oatmeal not too hot and not too cold. Just right. My favorite hot oats recipe has a banana in it and a few weeks ago the texture started to bother me. (Just another thing to give up during this pregnancy!) Breakfast hasn't been filling me up lately so I decided to give the cold overnight oats a try. Am I ever glad I did! They are healthy, filling and delicious! [Here](http://iowagirleats.com/2013/01/15/make-ahead-fruit-yogurt-breakfast-parfaits/) is the recipe that I have been enjoying this week. My only add on is to sprinkle walnuts on right before I eat it in the morning.  
  
Recently, I bought a new phone. I thought I was going to go with the new iphone but I ended up with the Incredible Android. I love it. I'm so glad I chose this one over the more popular iphone. The only thing I was disappointed in was the camera. It was really hard to take pictures. They were dark and blurry. I expected more. Then my husband realized (after looking at it for me for about two seconds) that the Verizon guy that put the phone case on when I bought it forgot to take the plastic covering off of the lens. Problem solved and now I love _everything_ about my new phone!  
  
S'mores are one of my new pregnancy cravings. Here is a picture with my plastic coated lens from my phone. Blurry but yummy and messy. My kids were happy about this craving!

Outdoor toys make fun (but very loud!) indoor toys during the winter. Or at least until an unseasonably warm January day to take them outside and do some lawn maintenance.

My book club meets on Monday. We're reading "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn. It's a good read so far but I'm still having problems finishing it. I have a ways to go but will give it my all this weekend. I never know if I should start my book club selection a week or two weeks before we meet. Sometimes if I do two weeks I finish too soon and have a hard time remembering what I want to discuss. Lately my problem has been finishing the book so I guess that means I need to start it earlier.
