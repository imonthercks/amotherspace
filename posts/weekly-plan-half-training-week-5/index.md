title: "Weekly Plan: Half Training Week 5"

It looks like I accomplished all my running goals last week other than going a little too slow on my easy run days. I ran two easy runs last week (average pace 11:12 and 10:52) and to meet my goal I should have been between a 10:12 and 10:42. It seems like 10:00 is most comfortable for me and when I try and slow it down a little bit it ends up being too much. I'll keep working on this. Part of me just wants to run it at 10:00 because that is comfortable for an easy run. I don't feel like I am pushing it too much but then the stronger part (right now) wants to try and do this training correctly and then see how it helps me on race day. So I'm sticking with trying to hit the slower paces for now.  
  
Here is my plan for this week:  
  
Monday: Rest  
Tuesday: 3-4 miles easy (10:12-10:42) and Strength  
Wednesday: 7x400 speed work (with warm up, cool down and slower intervals it will equal about 5 miles) (Tempo pace 8:42-9:51)  
Thursday: 3 miles easy (10:12-10:42)  
Friday: Strength  
Saturday: 8 miles long (10:12-11:12)  
Sunday: 3 miles recovery jog (11:12-11:42) and Strength  
Weekly Total: About 23 miles  
  
I look at all the pace goals above and it just seems so slow. I guess I will need to concentrate on the quicker paces on Wednesday to help me feel better about it! This will be my first week (hopefully!) with accurate speed work data because I am going outside where the GPS works and not inside at the Y where the last two workouts have had issues.
