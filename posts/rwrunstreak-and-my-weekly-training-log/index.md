I might just be going crazy but I've decided to join the Runner's World Summer Run Streak. What does this mean? I'm going to run _at least a mile_ every day between Memorial Day and Independence Day. That's 39 days total. Pretty crazy since my last running streak was probably 5 days, maybe.   
  
Even more crazy is that I'm training to run two half-marathons. One in September and one in October. That means that some of these miles will be very _slow_ on 'rest' days.   
  
But I'm in. It sounds like fun so I can't resist. Wish me luck!

With a new route and race day, running this week was pretty fun. My postpartum (3 months!) pace is getting closer to pre-pregnancy. I ran a 10:15 easy run on Friday which is a little closer to the 9:30 easy run pace I'm used to. Baby steps, right?  
  
The Get Your Rear in Gear 5k and Fun Run was last night and really was so much fun. Our first race as a family! I'm working on my recap and will have it up for you tomorrow!
