Today as I set out for my 3 mile recovery jog that my training called for I decided to try something that I'm not very good at. Negative splits. Basically a negative split run means that you progressively add speed to your workout. I forgot to look to see what my pace was supposed to be today but I knew that it was slow. I started out pretty slow which is hard for me. I always have to make myself slow down after running a little but today I was able to keep it under control and start out a bit slower. I'm proud to say that the negative splits worked for me today. I was able to bump up each mile lap just a little bit and end faster than I started. Here are my splits:

| 2 | 23:12 | 11'32"/mi |
| 3 | 34:22 | 11'10"/mi |

When I got home I looked to see what my pace was supposed to be and I guess I was right on target. My range was supposed to be 11:12-11:42 today. I probably couldn't have planned that closer if I had tried!  
  
Distance: 3 miles

Average Pace: 11:27  
  
My own personal Real Food Challenge is going pretty well. I have decided to concentrate on one or two things a week to try and cut out processed foods.  
  
Last week we switched to whole grain pasta. I made a pasta salad for lunches throughout the week. It was pretty good! Little O ate it up maybe even better than the regular pasta. I found a recipe for a [Zesty Italian](http://www.pennilessparenting.com/2010/07/perfect-homemade-italian-dressing.html) that turned out really good and I used that on the pasta salad instead of store bought dressing.  
  
This afternoon was my second try at my version of a Veggie Salad with Wheatberries and Quinoa. I found the recipe [here](http://ohsheglows.com/2012/02/16/whole-foods-layered-salad-with-oil-free-orange-ginger-dressing/). I love this salad! Two weeks ago when I made it I didn't put in the Wheatberries (our grocery store didn't carry them) but I just added them to my salad for this week. Instead of the dressing from the recipe I am going to use the Zesty Italian from last week.  
  
Lastly, we are trying to find a good whole wheat bread to make in our bread machine. I bought the ingredients and my husband actually went ahead and made it. It fell towards the end of baking but C.J. researched what happened and we are going to try again. It turned out o.k. but it is pretty dense.
