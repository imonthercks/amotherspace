Nap time for the kids means it's time to put my feet up and do a little blogging.

So sweet!  
  
2013 is off to a good start and I'm looking forward to a great year.   
  
Resolutions have really never been for me but this year I would like to set some fitness goals. The beginning of the year just seems like a natural time to do this. So here goes...  
  
I'm currently 32 weeks pregnant and due with baby #3 at the end of February. For the first two months of the year I want to continue walking and strength training to keep my current fitness level and hopefully help with delivery.   
  
After the baby is born (It's getting closer and I'm READY!) I plan to follow what the doctor recommends. If he says 6 weeks until I can run again then I'll wait the 6 weeks. Instead I'll start walking again as soon as I feel comfortable doing so.   
  
Mid April I'm going to start building up my running base by starting out slowly. I'll continue to walk some days and add in a couple of running days per week until I work up to running 5 days a week again. I can't wait! Just typing it is making me excited.   
  
I don't have any real plans right now to race any 5K's, 10K's or any other shorter distances this year. (Not to say that I won't decide to sign up for something later!) Instead I am going focus on my goal race of the year and that is a fall half marathon.

The Prairie Fire race series is on October 13th this year and so I'll start a training program sometime in June.  
  
After the race I'll continue on with my maintenance. I'll work on building my base to perhaps run another half marathon in the spring of 2014 and ultimately work towards my 2014 fall marathon goal.
