1\. Favorite quote from my son this week.

2\. Best compliment of the week. My son told me "I have a silly Mommy." Made my day.

  

3\. I laid my daughter down to watch the kids playing in the play room. She fell asleep so we moved to the kitchen table to do coloring and stickers. There is no way she would have napped for long if we continued to play or if I had attempted to move her. I'm glad the bigger kids were flexible and changed their activity!

4\. I'm trying to participate in the June photo a day challenge on Instagram. It's fun and has made me take a few pictures that I wouldn't have thought about otherwise. Are you on Instagram? Let's connect. Follow me [**here**](http://instagram.com/amotherspace) and then let me know so I can follow you back. This is my {environment} photo of my backyard.

5\. I'm pretty sad that my birthday coffee is gone. I enjoyed my last cup yesterday. It comes all the way from Texas so I'm going to have to bribe my brother to bring some with him every time he visits.

Bonus: I'm still streaking. I finished my 12th day this morning!
