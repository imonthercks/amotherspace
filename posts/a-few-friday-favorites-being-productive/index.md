I missed my Friday Favorites last week because we were on [vacation in Tulsa](http://amotherspace.net/2014/06/running-in-tulsa-chicago-marathon-training-week-2/ "Running in Tulsa [Chicago Marathon Training: Week 2]"). I'm back this week and so I'm including favorites from the past two weeks as a bonus!

My husband was off of work for 5 work days and Wednesday was our first day back to normal. I don't know what got into me but Wednesday afternoon was incredibly productive. I made phone calls, worked on the computer, cleaned, made dinner did a bunch of mom stuff and it felt great. If only I could be that productive all of the time!

We are enjoying having some family visiting for the weekend so it will be pretty low key. My favorite kind of weekend! Enjoy your Friday and have a great weekend!

**\[one\]** One thing you'll definitely see on my Instagram account is a daily update on my workout. Usually accompanied by a shot of my Nike+ Sportwatch, some scenery and maybe my shoes of the day. **\[two\]** We finally made it to our local YMCA pool this week. We made it just in time too because as we were getting out of the pool to head home the pool was cleared due to thunder. **\[three\]** Yoga, I'm loving it and adding it into my routine more often and so are the kids. It's fun to have them stretch out with me after a run, not relaxing, but fun. **\[four\]** My long run was on Sunday this week so I rode the spin bike on Monday. I usually spin for 20 minutes with 10 minutes of climb intervals before I hop off the bike for a strength, core and kettlebell workout. Then I repeat the bike portion for a 60 minute workout. **\[five\]** The Zoo! We love our local zoo and just renewed our membership for the summer.

## Currently Reading

I started reading [Anatomy for Runners](http://amzn.to/1pEHR60) (affiliate link) by Jay Dicharry while I was on vacation last week. I ordered the actual book to read instead of buying it for the Kindle. Boy do I love holding a real book again! I'm only about 25 pages in but I can tell that it is already helping my form. I'm trying to think more about how I'm running instead of just going out the door and hitting the pavement. I'll keep you updated the more I get into this book.
