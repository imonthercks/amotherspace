Yesterday I finally took a few minutes to figure out what my half marathon training plan is going to be this time around. Just in time too because my training officially started today with 3 miles this morning.  
  
I ended up meshing two plans together. I used Hal Higdon's [Novice 2 plan](http://bit.ly/13jrgcW) for the mileage and I used the [Finish It plan](http://bit.ly/16t7Sfo) from [Train Like a Mother](http://amzn.to/10eETuP) (by Sarah Bowen Shea and Dimity McDowell) to add in strides and speed work.  
  
I'm pretty excited about this plan but I'm nervous about it too. The strides (up to 10 at the end) and the speed work will be tough. While postpartum running has been difficult, I'm ready to really get back into running and this plan will help me.

And the streaking continues. Day 29 was this morning. The rest day 1 milers are still pretty fun. I'm not burned out on running and the end is in sight. It might feel weird to _not_ run for a day after this streak is over.
