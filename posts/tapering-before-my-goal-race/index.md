My taper last week was pretty active. I merged two plans together and decided to run the higher mileage only if I was feeling it. Apparently I was because I met the high end of all of my runs in the training plan.  
  
I missed my early wake up on Tuesday but decided to run with the girls after dropping my son of at preschool. Boy, is pushing that double stroller in the Kansas wind a challenge!   
  
I had to rig up a blanket mid run to block the wind from the girls on the way home. They were all bundled up inside and still enjoyed the ride.

My race yesterday went very well. It was no doubt one of the most enjoyable races that I have done. More on that tomorrow though.

**Do you stick to a plan during taper week?**

Staying at home with kids sounds easy, right? Life with 3 little ones is busier than I imagined. I don't write every day on the blog but I do update Facebook, Twitter and Instagram more often.
