1. 
We are FINALLY in my due date month! WAHOO!!! Now, if only my due date weren't at the END of the month on February 28th! Yes, I'm excited and I used a lot of capitals and exclamation points!!  
  
2. 
I accidentally ordered my White Chocolate Mocha with caffeine, instead of my normal decaff. I decided to go ahead and drink it because I hadn't had any caffeine that day and a little wouldn't hurt, right? That was the only day in recent history that I have not needed a nap in the afternoon. Amazing!

3. 
I've had a couple contractions while walking on the treadmill. So far, I have just paused the treadmill, drank a little water and after the contraction passed I started up my workout again. I'm having a lot more Braxton Hicks contractions this time around and my doctor says that it's normal with a third pregnancy to have an increase.  
  
4. 
Pregnancy insomnia is tough. I'm up a lot at night so it makes me tired during the day. I've given up trying to not sleep during the kids' nap time because I can't keep my eyes open anymore. It's just a vicious circle. I'm still tired by 9:00 at night but then have troubles sleeping throughout the night.   
  
5. 
Smoothies are my new ice cream, at least they are helping me to stay away from my ice cream craving during the day. It definitely isn't hurting to get an extra serving of Spinach and fruit in my diet!
