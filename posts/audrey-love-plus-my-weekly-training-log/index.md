Just popping in quickly to update my training log this week. It's been a busy weekend of racing and family adventures. I'll be back soon with a recap from the Prairie Fire Half Marathon that I ran yesterday.  May the Fourth is a fun day to have a half marathon and I can't wait to share it with you!

Before I get to the training log...did you see this one yesterday? I just love Audrey and this [Google Doodle](http://google.com) is lovely.

Alright so here's my training log from last week. It's the week before a race so I tapered a little, of course.
