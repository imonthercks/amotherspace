It was crazy windy outside on Sunday so I decided to take my recovery jog inside at the Y on the track.

I think I have finally figured out how to make running at the Y work for me! I've had a couple failed attempts ([here](http://healthymomontherun.blogspot.com/2012_02_01_archive.html#8226826931433224876) and [here](http://healthymomontherun.blogspot.com/2012_02_01_archive.html#7020895815705981091).) With a little trial and error my run today went well and I was able to get the data for my running log. First, I downloaded a stopwatch to my phone. I timed the whole run and I was able to tap the phone for each mile split. Secondly, I purchased a lap counter last week and I put it to good use today during my 27 laps around the track. It was very nice not having to constantly think about what lap I was on in order to accurately track my mileage.

My only problem was that I ran at a comfortable pace and it ended up being too fast for my scheduled recovery jog. The purpose of a recovery jog is to help shake out your legs after a hard workout the day before. Some people rest on the recovery day or some people do a cross training activity. I have chosen to do recovery jogs for this training cycle. It is important to run SLOWLY to not add any more stress to your legs. I need to work on this. I felt like I was going slowly and then I would glance down at the time and see that it was still too fast. Splits: 9:30, 9:43, 10:14

  

Distance: 3 miles

Time: 29:28

Average Pace: 9:50

  

It's Monday so here is a look back at my 10th week of training:
