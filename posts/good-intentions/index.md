Lately, it seems, I've had good intentions with menu planning. The past couple of weeks I've had a hard time sticking with it. We've eaten out a bit more than normal and I have a lot of excuses. But that's what they are, excuses, so I'm trying to get back on track and really stick to a menu plan this week. Wish me luck!  
  
\[breakfast\]  
Yogurt with homemade granola or eggs this week.

\[lunch\]  
Leftover Christmas spiral cut ham was delicious on sandwiches this week! This local 3 ingredient bread is a favorite of ours.

\[dinner out\]  
We celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary this week with dinner and a movie. Sushi and Catching Fire!

\[babyfood\]  
I'm absolutely sure that one of the benefits of being a third child is that you get ice cream and chocolate before your first birthday. Little E has had ice cream a couple times now and, she's just like her mommy, she LOVES it.
