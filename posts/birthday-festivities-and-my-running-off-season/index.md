Today my little girl turns 3 years old.  
  
We celebrated over the weekend with our family and friends.   
  
She had a Dora themed party with a Dora cake. Little A helped with the flowers on her dress.  
  
We're celebrating more today with some homemade pizza and cupcakes tonight for dinner and dessert. 3 years old! Where does the time go?  
  
Last week was a good week for running. I don't have a specific race on the calendar so I'm just taking it easy during my 'off season.' My busy weekend of birthday festivities led to a run-free weekend.

It's starting to get really cold here. One of my runs from the week was a windchill of 12 degrees. Brrr!! I do have the treadmill to fall back on but I still like to get out and run even if it is super cold out.
