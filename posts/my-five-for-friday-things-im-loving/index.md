1\. Can't wait to dig in to Runner's World this month. Since I'm running two half marathons in the fall I'm hoping to pick up a lot of tips, inspiration and motivation.

2\. Garden fresh tomatoes. Need I say more?

3\. My new [Camelbak hydration pack](http://amzn.to/136wbf4). It took a little tweeking to get it to fit right (thanks to my husband!!) but now that it is I've taken it on every run. I've even been wearing it on the shorter runs.

4\. I can't get enough of her smiles.

5\. And finally, these silly faces. I'm such a lucky mommy to get to spend my days with 3 precious children.
