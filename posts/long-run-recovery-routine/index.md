With 11 miles on the schedule for my long run on Sunday, I knew I wanted to help my recovery by spending a little extra time stretching and foam rolling.  
  
The run itself was pretty nice. I ran all the way to the park, then ran around in the park for a little bit before heading back home.

I'm working on a running fuel post but I wanted to go ahead and write out what I did this weekend because it seemed to work pretty well for me. Before running I had a piece of toast with peanut butter and a glass of Nuun. During my run I ate a packet of Honey Stinger energy chews and I also had a Honey Stinger Gel packet around mile 7. Of course, I also carried my pack with water which I sipped on throughout my run.  
  
Pretty soon after finishing the run I started the [Nike Training Club (NTC) Kara Goucher Pro Stretching Routine](http://bit.ly/18FTMbu). I LOVE doing this after a long run. I can't always spend the 15 minutes to get through it but I can really feel a difference when I make the time to get it done.   
  
Later on in the day I was exhausted. I tried to lay down for awhile but then I realized that my brain wasn't tired but my body was so I broke out the foam roller to try and relax my legs a little. I found a [new rolling routine](http://bit.ly/18FUFRB) and it worked out my legs nicely. My calves are so tight all the time so I definitely love/hate rolling my calves out.   
  
Again, spending just a few minutes rolling out my legs makes all the difference. When I woke up the next morning my calves were not as tight and overall my legs felt great.

**How do you recover after a long run? What do you use to fuel during your run?**

Staying at home with kids sounds easy, right? Life with 3 little ones is busier than I imagined. I don't write every day on the blog but I do update Facebook, Twitter and Instagram more often.
