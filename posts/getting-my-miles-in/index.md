title: "Getting My Miles In"

We have a busy weekend coming up and I was worried about when I would be able to get my 12 mile long run in. Lucky for me it worked out...my mom was able to come over and watch the kids this morning! Thanks, Mom!  
  
  
The run was fun. I focused on keeping it slow and steady.

I think I succeeded! 

  

Best thing about the run: Seeing birds. I saw a male and female cardinal on the sidewalk that I scared away when I ran by them. I also ran over a bridge and scared away a large blue heron...which was beautiful (and my favorite bird!)

  

Worst thing(s) about the run: construction and stoplights. I had to stop at both a few times during the run and I don't like how my legs feel when I have to start running again. 

  

It was strange running on a Friday morning. There weren't very many runners out and the traffic was crazy. Of course it was rush hour so I was expecting it and I was happy for the sidewalks.

  

Distance: 12.01 miles

Time: 2:09:55

Average Pace: 10:49

  

This was my last long run of the training cycle! I'm tapering (a little) next week and then the HALF MARATHON is on Sunday!
