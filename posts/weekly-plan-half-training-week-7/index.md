title: "Weekly Plan: Half Training Week 7"
date: "2012-03-19"

Last week ended up being a low mileage week. My plan called for two rest or easy run days because of the 4 mile race on Saturday. I really wanted to get out there and run on those two days (Thursday and Sunday) but it didn't work out either day. Only 11 total miles last week! I prefer running days to non running days so this morning when I woke up to lightning I was very disappointed to miss my early morning run. This is why I would LOVE a treadmill. I can't believe that I just put the word love in the same sentence as treadmill. I'm still hoping to head to the Y after C.J. gets off work this evening.  
  
  
My 4 mile tempo run on Wednesday went very well. I wanted it to give me a good idea of what I should shoot for with my [St. Patrick's Day race](http://healthymomontherun.blogspot.com/2012_03_01_archive.html#6051035570580026733) (because it was the same distance) and that's exactly what happened. I ran in the afternoon and even though it was hot and windy I ran really fast (for me!) and finished in 37 minutes and 29 seconds at a 9:21 pace. I set my race day goal for 35 minutes. I was hoping to shave off 2 minutes or so with the race day adrenaline. I almost met my goal! Next time...  
  
  
Here are my splits from Wednesday:

Distance: 4 miles  
Time: 37:29  
Average Pace: 9:21  
  
  
I have entered in my time from the race on Saturday (35:34) into the [McMillian Running Calculator](http://mcmillanrunning.com/calculator). I'll use these new training paces as a guide for all of my upcoming easy, tempo, interval, long and recovery runs. I'm excited to have an accurate race time to work with. Before this race I was averaging the numbers between my half marathon last Fall and my ultimate goal of running a half marathon in under two hours. According to the calculator, I should be able to run my April half marathon in 2 hours and 5 minutes if my fitness level stays the same. That shaves over 10 minutes off of my PR half marathon! So my new goal is to run the April 29th 13.1 miles in under  2:05:42. 
  
  
Here is my plan for week 7:  
  
  
Monday: 3 to 4.5 miles (easy 10:38-11:08 pace)  
Tuesday: Strength and 3 miles (easy 10:38-11:08 pace)  
Wednesday: 8x400 meters (with warm up, cool down and slower intervals it will end up being about 5 miles) (Intervals 9:05-9:23 pace)  
Thursday: 3 miles (easy 10:38-11:08 pace)  
Friday: Strength  
Saturday: 9 miles (long 10:38-11:38 pace)  
Sunday: 3-4 miles (recovery 11:38-12:08 pace)  
  
  
My totals for the week should be between 26 and 28.5. Nothing like my measly 11 from last week. :)
