I've been running for many years (since junior high track) but I would always stay under the 5 mile mark. Maybe I ran more than that a few times during cross country in high school but mainly I kept the miles pretty low.

Then in 2006 I decided to run a half marathon and I haven't really ever turned back. I vividly remember how hard that first ever 10 mile run was. So tough and I couldn't imagine adding 3.1 miles on top of that! But I did it and since then I've gone on to run a marathon.

Why am I thinking back on my miles? I ran my long run on the treadmill this weekend. It wasn't that long of a run for me (8 miles) but it got me thinking back to the first few times that I had run that distance and how far I've come in the past several years.   
  
Back when I first started running longer distances I never would have imagined running 8 miles on a treadmill, for fun. Outside was hard enough so I didn't even consider the treadmill.   
  
This weekend I wanted to run outside but the roads and sidewalks were just too snowy and icy. It wasn't that tough of a decision to stay inside and run. Running for 1 hour and 13 minutes on a treadmill might not have been my first choice but I still enjoyed the run.

9 miles is my personal distance record on the treadmill but probably not for long. I'm sure I'll have to take a long run inside at some point this year while I'm training for my spring half or my fall full and, strangely, I'm kind of looking forward to it.

I think the reason why I wanted to write this all out was to remember how far I've come in my running journey. Running these longer distances during training is something I look forward to now and not something that seems as impossible as it once did.
