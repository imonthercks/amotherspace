8 days in for the #RWRunStreak and still going strong. I earned this

from Nike+ all because of the run streak. I'm pretty sure that 7 days in a row is my longest streak ever. But I'm not done yet!

A few things I've learned from streaking:  

- Running for 1 mile is fun. 
- I'm still enjoying each and every run, even if I'm not excited to run before I get out there. **I never regret a run.**
- It's hard to get motivated to run in the evening. On busy days I just have to do it anyway. **I never regret a run.**
- Running daily creates quite a bit more laundry. I have 3 sports bras that are comfortable for me (as a nursing mother, comfort is my top priority!!) so I have to wash running clothes at least every 3 days. This will make laundry during vacation interesting!

I've decided to start tracking my pace from each run on my weekly training log. Hopefully this will show that my pace average is going down over the weeks and months ahead.
