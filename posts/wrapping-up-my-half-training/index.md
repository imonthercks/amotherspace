Today I ran my last training run for the Johnston's Half Marathon on Sunday....this Sunday! It feels like so long ago that I decided to run the race and train. It's finally here and I'm READY TO RUN!  
  
  
Numbers motivate me. I like to think about weekly and monthly mileage. I'm at 269 miles for the year.

Compared to a lot of people out there that isn't very much but for me that is a lot and I'm excited! I've never trained for a race in the spring and to have that many miles accomplished already before the year is half over is exciting....I already said that, I know. :)  
  
  
Here's something else that's motivating: looking back on the mileage during a training cycle. I officially started training on Feb. 5th although I had been running a pretty steady base before that. Here are all of my training runs:

This training cycle I did a few things differently than I have in the past.

- I added tempo runs
- I added interval runs
- I continued with strength training
- I ran 5 days a week

The mix above is working so far. I was pleasantly surprised by my two races in the past couple of weeks. I was a lot faster than I have been in the past. That makes me excited and nervous for this weekend. I'm nervous because I want to run fast (for me) but I also know that beating my old PR by 16 minutes will be very challenging and it might not happen this time around. I need to give it my all and be happy with the results. (I'm going to say this over and over in my head for the next few days!)

  

So bare with me while I record the numbers to wrap up my training this time around.

One last bit of information...my pace graph. This will be interesting (for me!!) to look back on after some time has gone by and compare it to a (hopefully) faster pace as I continue to gain speed during my running.
