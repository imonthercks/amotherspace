I think I was more nervous before this race than my first full marathon last fall. This was the first race that I had a time goal and I wanted to do more than just finish. I really wanted to get the 4 miles finished in 35 minutes.  
  
I decided to run in the St. Patrick's Day Party & Run 4 mile race because it was a fundraiser for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. I had originally wanted to do a 5K race at this point in my training but decided to throw in the extra mile for a good cause. I'm glad I did because it was a fun race.  
  
The race started at 10 a.m. and I'm not used to running at that point in the day. I was a little nervous about eating correctly. Usually before I run early in the morning I have homemade [protein bites](http://gimmesomeoven.com/no-bake-energy-bites/) but since the race was later I knew I needed a complete breakfast. C.J. made French Toast. Perfect! I also limited myself to 1 cup of coffee instead of my usual 2 and I had some water before we left the house.  
  
I got there early to pick up my packet and get ready to run. I met up with Kristie and Lamont before the race.

 Before I knew it we were off. I have never used my Nike+ watch in a race before and I was worried that the GPS wouldn't link up in time so I started the sensor a couple of minutes early. I was planning on hitting 'start' as soon as I crossed the chip timer. Planning is the key word in that sentence. I hit start and my whole screen went blank! My fully charged watch just died on me. ARG!!!

Yep, C.J. captured a pic of me FREAKING OUT because I am now super dependent on watching my pace while I run to stay on track. I yelled something about my pace and just took off running. It really threw me off because I was so worried that I would run too fast in the beginning and then not be able to have a strong finish.

 I had calmed down a little in the middle of the first mile when C.J. took this pic. Evidently I run with my eyes closed. The course was really pretty. We ran through a developing neighborhood and on some roads around a shopping area.

 It was a windy day here in Kansas...shocking, I know! I'm used to running in the wind so I wasn't that concerned about it. Around the 3 mile marker we had a straight run headed South directly into the wind. I kept repeating in my head "I can do it. The wind is not that strong. I run in the wind all the time. I can pass these people...." And I did, pass people that is, several of the people in front of me slowed way down for the wind and I \*think\* it makes me run faster. Maybe I would \*know\* it made me run faster if my watch was working!

 C.J. snapped this one of me crossing the finish line. Both feet off the ground! The time said 36 something and I was pretty disappointed until I remembered that I was at the back when we started and my chip timing would be different. Official race time: 35:34. 34 little seconds from my goal time. I'll take it!

Time: 35:34  
Pace: 8:54  
Placement: 140th out of 541

 My wonderful husband and daughter cheered me on (and took fun pictures) during the race.

 Snuggling in to get out of the wind.

 Watching Mommy run 4 miles is tough work.
