On Sunday I set out for my run having no distance or pace in mind. Not having a training plan right now is strange but these type of runs are fun. No expectation except to enjoy the run.  
  
About a quarter mile in I realized that it was December 1st and probably my best chance to run my [Fall 5 and 10 Virtual Race](http://www.mommyrunfast.com/virtual-run-series/fall-5-and10-registration/) so I started to speed up.

It was unseasonably warm and I only had to wear a short sleeve t-shirt and shorts, in December!! I ran and just enjoyed the beautiful weather and the time spent by myself.   
  
One surprising thing is that more runner's weren't out to enjoy the weather. I think I only saw one other person while I was out.  
  
Soon it was time to turn around for my out and back route. Overall, a very uneventful run but memorable because of the warm weather.

Back in September, when I started this series, my goal was to run each race a little faster. Each race I was able to increase my speed, that is, until the last one. I was so close too! My biggest problem was not checking what my pace should have been before I left the house. While running I honestly thought that I needed a 9 minute pace to meet my goal. Too bad last month I ran it with an 8:57 average pace.
