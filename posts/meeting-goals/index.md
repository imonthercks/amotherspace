I did it! One of my goals that I set was to run a mile in a workout under a 9:20 pace. I blew that goal away today and I ran my entire 3 miles at an average pace of 9:12 and my fastest mile was 8:49! I've been working hard, running 5 days a week, adding speed work, paying more attention to the actual pace that I am supposed to run for my tempo, long, and easy runs and it is paying off! I couldn't be more excited about it.  
  
For the first time I went out for a run this week without music and didn't even think about it. When I run in the dark in the mornings I don't listen to music but when I would go out during daylight I would still take music along. On my run on Sunday I didn't even realize that I hadn't taken music with me until about 30 minutes after my run. If I had been told 6 months ago that I would enjoy running without music I would have never believed it...but now I think I actually prefer it. I will still listen to music on easy run days if I am in the mood but I really like paying attention to how I am running instead of trying to distract myself with music in my ears.
