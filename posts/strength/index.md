Last week was the week of strength training. Something clicked and I wanted to do it, so I did. I ended up doing 5 workouts and spending well over an hour on my strength for the week.

I didn't give up any running but I did make some changes to make it happen. The biggest change was _making_ the time for strength _at the same time_ that I am running. I don't do a good job at fitting in double day workouts but it's also hard to have enough time for running and strength in the morning.  
  
The photo above is my [Instagram](http://instagram.com/amotherspace) post from my workout on Thursday. 15 minutes of core work followed by 3 miles of 400 repeats on the treadmill.  
  
I made it a priority this week and I crushed my goal of doing 2-3 strength workouts a week.

I already feel stronger and I'm excited to keep this up during half marathon training starting soon.  
  
I also got on the spin bike again this week. It was shorter due to time limitations (30 minutes) but still felt like a quality workout.

**Do you strength train regularly? Do you exercise all at once during the day or break it up to fit it in?**
