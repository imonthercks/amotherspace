Running in 2012 wasn't exactly what I thought it would be but overall I'm happy with how my year turned out. Pregnancy affected my running a lot more than I thought it would but I was able to keep it up through 27 weeks of pregnancy.

My goal race for the year was the Johnston's Half Marathon in April. Training went well and I ended up with a PR. My postpartum goal race for next year will also be a half marathon but we'll talk about that later.  
  
Here is my year in numbers.  
  
516.9: Number of overall running miles
