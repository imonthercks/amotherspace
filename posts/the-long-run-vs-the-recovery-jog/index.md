Give me a long run any day over a recovery jog. Today my 4 mile recovery jog was much more difficult than the 9 I did yesterday. It's hard to compare the two runs because of so many differences.  
  
  
Yesterday: About 45 degrees when I left the house. Today: 75 degrees  
  
  
Yesterday: Stayed close to my long run pace goal. (ran 10:22, goal was 10:38) Today: Ran too fast. I completed my run with an average 10:53 pace and it was supposed to be between 11:38 and 12:08. It's just too slow for me...I'm definitely not bragging about being fast here...10:53 is pretty slow for most runners.  
  
  
Yesterday: Morning run, did not drink the night before. Today: Afternoon run, drank wine the night before.  
  
  
Yesterday: Out and back route. Today: Two 2 mile loops around my neighborhood...boring.  
  
  
There are probably more differences but those are the few that I can think of right away. Even if everything was the same between the two runs I would still pick a long run over the recovery jog. There's just something exciting and unknown about heading out for high mileage.
