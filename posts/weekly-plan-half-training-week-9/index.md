Looking back on goals helps me to meet new ones. Here is an update on my plan for last week and then I will get to what I expect from my training this week...week 9!  
  
  
Monday  

- Rest 

Tuesday  

- goal: 4 miles easy (10:38-11:08 pace) 
- actual: 4 miles @ 10:37 average pace

Wednesday  

- goal: 5 miles tempo (9:12-9:36 pace)
- actual: 5 miles @ 9:45 average pace...[tough workout!](http://healthymomontherun.blogspot.com/2012_03_01_archive.html#759180899328362209)

Thursday 

- goal: 3 miles easy (10:38-11:08 pace)
- actual: rest...waking up early didn't work so I switched my Thursday & Friday runs

Friday 

- goal: Strength
- actual: 3 miles easy @ 10:50 average pace while [pushing a stroller](http://healthymomontherun.blogspot.com/2012_03_01_archive.html#3278846664283414765), no strength workout :(

Saturday  

- goal: 10 miles long (10:38-11:38 pace)
- actual: 10 miles @ 10:50 average pace

Sunday  

- 4 miles recovery (11:38-12:08)
- actual: 4 miles @ 10:39 average pace....oops!

Overall it was a good week and I'm happy where I am at right now in my training. I have my two races coming up this month and I am feeling good about both of them!

  

Now to this week...

  

Monday: Rest...ahhh, done. :)

  
  
Tuesday: Strength & 3-5 miles easy (10:38-11:08)

  
  
Wednesday: 9x400 (Between 5 & 6 miles total with warm up, cool down and 2 minutes or under for each 400 interval with a 400 rest in between.)

  
  
Thursday: Rest or 3 miles easy (10:38-11:08 pace)

  
  
Friday: Strength

  
  
Saturday: 10K RACE DAY! I might also try a couple miles for a shake down run later in the afternoon. I've heard good things about doing a recovery run the same day as a race or hard workout.

  
  
Sunday: Rest, Cross, or 5 mile run 

  
  
  

Evidently I'm indecisive this week when it comes to meshing my two training plans. For my overall training I have combined Hal Higdon's [Novice 2](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51312/Half-Marathon-Novice-2-Training-Program) and [Intermediate](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51132/Half-Marathon-Intermediate-Training-Program) training programs. It's working really well for me and most of the time when I plan for a week I just go ahead and decide at that time what I will run and it has typically included more of the intermediate guide. Because I am up to such high weekly mileage and it is a race week I want to leave it up to how my body feels and not get stressed out about putting in certain mileage. I want to accomplish the higher end on all of these goals but only time will tell this week.
