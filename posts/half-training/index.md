This week I have bumped up my normal running (a little) to start training for my half marathon coming up in April. I have mixed Hal Higdon's Novice and Intermediate Half Marathon training programs to come up with something that works for me. I also want to improve my time so I have added speed work. Today is my first day of that so we'll see how it goes! Here are my training plans for this week:  
  
Tuesday: 3 mi (already finished)  
Wednesday: 5x400m  
Thursday: 3 mi  
Saturday: 4 mi  
Sunday: Cross or 3 mi
