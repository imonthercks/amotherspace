Last week marked the end of my training plan for the 5K. It's the first time that I've followed a plan before a 5K. Technically, I didn't follow the entire plan because I jumped into the middle of it after running my half marathon in October.   
  
What plan did I follow? I went with the classic Hal Higdon **[Intermediate Training Program](http://halhigdon.com/training/50934/5K-Intermediate-Training-Program)**.

I took it a little easier on myself than a normal training plan. Once, I was supposed to run a 7 mile long run but I couldn't get it in over the weekend and I didn't sweat it. I just ran the 4 miles that I was able to get in and called it good. I've never missed a long run during a half or full training cycle.

I like following training plans because it motivates me to run. If I have a set distance and pace to run for the day it is much easier for me to actually accomplish it. I discovered that this is true even for a 5K training plan.

I didn't really take my 'taper' week seriously last week. Just running short 2 milers made me want to run faster. I'm ready to run faster.

I really like speed work. Whether it's 400 repeats or a tempo run, it is the run that I look forward to all week.
