Last week I had to make my plan flexible to get the runs in. I switched a rest and easy run day. I ran with the kids in the afternoon and shortened my run because pushing the stroller is a tough workout. I had to guess my speed work again because my shoe pod didn't work inside at the Y. I also ran a tempo run on Sunday instead of a recovery jog. What??? Yes, I was trying to meet a Nike+ goal (run a 9:30 avg.) mile by Feb. 26th and I HAD to try for it. I ran two miles at a 9:25 pace and I MET my goal! My next pace goal will not be such a huge jump from my average pace. I'll write about that later in the week.  
  
This week I am hoping that things go a little smoother but I'm not holding my breath! A is still teething and not sleeping through the night. O has been climbing into bed with us in the early morning and so it is hard to get out for a run at 5:30 and not wake everyone up. Hopefully all the sleeping arrangements will go back to normal soon.  
  
Here is my plan for the week:  
  
Monday: Rest  
Tuesday: 3-3.5 miles easy (10:12-10:42) and Strength  
Wednesday: 4 miles pace (9:12-10:00)  
Thursday: 3 miles easy (10:12-10:42)  
Friday: Strength  
Saturday: 7 miles long (10:12-11:12)  
Sunday: 2-3 miles recovery (11:12-11:42) or cross
