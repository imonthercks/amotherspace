I know I'm a little biased but I think my kids are pretty lucky. They have an amazing Daddy! So this Five for Friday is a tribute to him.   
  
1\. He takes time to play with the kids. He's a pretty busy guy and always has a bunch of projects that need to be accomplished (both for work and at home) but he loves to have fun with his kids.

2\. He loves the down time and the snuggles.

3\. Even if he is working on a big project he slows down a little and lets the kids help him. They will remember these special projects with Daddy for years. The new vegetable garden (below) was the big spring project.

4\. He's great at explaining things to the kids. They love to ask questions and he loves to answer them.

5\. He's very supportive and loving toward their Mommy. This picture below was taken while I was gone the morning of a race. He texted it to me so I could see they were cheering me on from miles away. (And on a side note, he is an excellent cook! He is in charge of weekend breakfasts and takes over for dinner a lot too.)

For these and 5 million other reasons, we love you, Daddy! Happy Father's Day!
