I love a good challenge and did I ever find one! My plan is to run 14 races in the year 2014. 
  
I'm joining [Jill](http://jillconyers.com/) and [Jen](http://runnershoe.blogspot.com/) as they host this virtual challenge to kick off 2014. 
  
You can pick various distances and personalize your challenge. Do you run a lot of marathons? Pick to run 14 marathons in 2014. (Sound crazy? I just listened to a podcast with a woman who ran _52 marathons_ in just one year. Find her inspirational story over on the [Another Mother Runner](http://anothermotherrunner.com/2013/12/21/marathon-goddess-imparts-wisdom/) website.)  
  
If 26.2x14 is a bit much for you, don't worry. You can pick any race distance: 13.1, 6.2, 5.1 or (my choice) a variety of the above.   
  
I plan on running several 5K's, a 10K or two, a half marathon and a full marathon next year. I'll add several virtual races to the list to help met my goal.   
  
My 2014 races start on January 1st at the local Frosty 5K. I've done it 3 or 4 times over the years and it's one of my favorite races of the year.  
  
There's still time to sign up! Head on over to [Jill's website](http://jillconyers.com/2013/12/14-in-2014/?utm_content=buffer6d00e&utm_source=buffer&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Buffer) and put your name on the list. Follow along with the challenge using the hashtag #14in2014. 
  
  

**Have you signed up to run 14 in 2014? What distance did you choose?**
