Lindsay over at [**The Lean Green Bean**](http://www.theleangreenbean.com/pin-it-party-3/) is hosting a pinning party and I'm joining in on the fun. Be sure to visit her blog to find a bunch of great posts to pin or to link up your own Pin It Party post.  
  
Are you following me on Pinterest? If not **[click here](http://www.pinterest.com/amotherspace)**. I pin recipes, strength workouts, treadmill workouts, motivational quotes and much more!  
  
Here are a few of my favorite posts from A Mother's Pace over the past couple of months.

[**It's Time to Make a Change**](http://bit.ly/17WlmP1)  
  
Do you eat 'real food?' How do you handle eating out and trying to eat quality food? An update on this post: We only ate out once during the entire month of August and that was for a birthday. All it took was a little bit of commitment to meal planning.

Staying at home with kids sounds easy, right? Life with 3 little ones is busier than I imagined. I don't write every day on the blog but I do update Facebook, Twitter and Instagram more often.
