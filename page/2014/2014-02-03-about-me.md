I'm Angie andÂ I'm passionate about my family and running so this is where I combine the two. My husband and three young children are very supportive of my training. I love hearing "Go, Mommy, Go!" during a race.

I am a former preschool teacher and currently a stay at home mother to three children ages 4 and under. We stay very busy with school and other activities throughout the week but we also love to stay home and enjoy time just with each other. My two oldest children have expressed some interest in running and have even participated in a couple of races! I'm looking forward to watching this interest grow as they get older.

This blog is my space to write about what I love. My family, running and an overall healthy lifestyle. I write running stories, training logs and race reports from my own experiences and I also share running tips and other things that have been helpful to me. Since this is A Mother's Pace, I also share stories and milestones of my children along with some of our day to day life. You can also look for a weekly menu plan on the blog with a lot of recipes in the post or links to where they are found.

I love to hear from you as well. I do my best to respond to comments left on the blog.
