38 weeks pregnant yesterday. Potentially, I could run again in 8 weeks. Two months. It's still a long time from now but it's getting closer.

I miss running and I can't wait!

My Valentines from my three loves. The flowers are beautiful, the chocolates are yummy and I can't wait for the wine in a couple of weeks!

I recently discovered Murray's Cheese at our grocery store...right here in Kansas! I love Murray's Cheese Shop in New York and was so happy to see that they have started to sell their cheese nationwide.

I miss playing on the floor with my kids. Watching them today with the cars on the floor really made me wish that I could get down there with them. It's hard to parent from the couch but unfortunately for me my body is very uncomfortable with all this extra baby weight and I can't be on my feet or at their level for very long at all. Gotta love the end of a pregnancy! Ha!

After weeks of waiting and months of shopping we finally have new furniture! We have new entry way, living room and dining room furniture and it all looks so nice. Our house that we have been living in for about a year and a half is finally starting to come together.
