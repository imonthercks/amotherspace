This week might be a first! A Friday Five post with no pictures or stories of my kids!? I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not because I'm missing their smiling faces in this post already. Read on for my thoughts on this Friday, they are mainly about running...go figure!  
  
\[1\]  
My new favorite thing about running after my husband gets off work in the evening is going straight to jammies after getting cleaned up.

I'm still streaking. Today marks the 15th day. My longest streak is 40 days which I completed this past summer. This official Runner's World Holiday Run Streak only lasts 34 days so I may have to extend it to better my streak.

I'm letting myself run 'fast' during one of my 1 milers each week. This week I increased my pace by 7 seconds and ran a 7:40 mile. It's so much fun to run fast!

I placed a cyber Monday order on Saucony's website. I'm always a little nervous to order clothes online without trying them on first. I'm happy to say that all of these items fit very well. I've worn the shorts on a treadmill run and LOVED them. They didn't ride up and the fabric is very light. _(In no way does Saucony sponsor me {in my dreams!!} I just like their products and want to share that with you.)_

My grandmother used to make stained glass ornaments and decorations. They are my most treasured ornaments on the Christmas tree.

**Do you have treasured ornaments on your tree?**

Happy Friday and have a wonderful weekend!
