I'm jumping right in this week.  
  
1\. My husband is now running regularly. I love to see this

out on our porch.  
  
  
2\. I'm so happy my kids love books and love playing together, most of the time, of course. So cute that he is sitting in a bucket here.

3\. I'm back to drinking darker beers again. After pregnancies I usually like light, refreshing wheat beers but lately I've been craving something with a little more substance.

My first time drinking this Milk Stout and I'll definitely drink it again.  
  
  
4\. I may or may not have splurged on this delicious fruit cobbler. O.k., I did but I shared it with my two kids and it was so worth it!

5\. My little super hero. I love him so much!
