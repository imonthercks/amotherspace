We are back from our Iowa vacation and had a wonderful time visiting family, friends and of course I spent some of that time running!  
There was a little [hotel treadmill running](http://bit.ly/13w0bXS). But more importantly there were beautiful outside runs as well.   
  
My five this week is all about running in Davenport, Iowa.  
  
1\. We had a grandpa to babysit the kiddos so my husband and I were able to run the streets of Davenport together.

2\. We ran a hilly route on a bridge.

3\. The bridge crossed over the Mississippi. Beautiful.

4\. When we ran over the bridge we crossed state lines and ended up in Moline, Illinois. First time I've ever crossed a state line while running.

5\. Roads were closed because of the flooding. The water was up pretty high.

I would have never picked to run over the bridge. My husband suggested it and even though the bridge was a tough run it was gorgeous. I'm so glad we did it!  
  

**Have you ever crossed state lines while running?**
