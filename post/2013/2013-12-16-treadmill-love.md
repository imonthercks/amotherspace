 It's been a great week of running to keep the streak alive. I only ran outside two out of the past seven days. I don't mind my treadmill at all when I think about running outside in the early morning cold and darkness.   
  
_I almost look forward to the treadmill._  
  
I've listened to podcasts a few times this week and I'm catching up on my Netflix shows. I get to wear shorts and don't have to spend time layering up and then washing all the layers later on.   
  
A treadmill means I can run during nap time. (At least when it works out.) This week I ran 5 400 repeats during my Little E's morning nap. The two big kids and I went downstairs. The kids played and I ran. I needed a mile for the streak, I wanted 3 for a good workout and I ended up with 4.5 because nap time lasted so long. I was able to shower and eat lunch before she woke up. _What???_

Yes, I'm definitely loving the treadmill this winter. And we don't even have snow yet. I'll be outside for that run, that first snowy run of the year.
