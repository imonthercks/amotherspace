When 2013 started I was very pregnant. I had no mileage goals, I just wanted to get back into running after my pregnancy.   
  
Recently I noticed how close I was to 600 miles so it became my goal to try and get past 600. That meant I had to run over 22 miles each week and so far I'm accomplishing it.   
  
22 miles isn't _that_ much for a week but I'm not training for anything and it's definitely more than I would have ran if I didn't want to hit a certain mileage number.   
  
I've already surpassed my highest mileage year (at least as long as I've been tracking the miles) and I have even bigger goals for next year.

It was another week of the treadmill. I did get out twice and enjoyed the cold but beautiful weather. Every other run was on the treadmill. I'm still streaking and only have 8 more runs to complete the holiday streak.
