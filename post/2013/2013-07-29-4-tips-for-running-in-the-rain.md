Finally, I've had an almost normal week of running. At least I was able to fit in all my main workouts and then I shuffled around a couple of easy and rest days to make it work.   
  
My favorite workout of the week was a strength and core workout on my back deck.  
  
I had this cute little face cheering me on.

My moves with the weights made her smile and giggle. Being laughed at while exercising isn't such a bad thing, right?  
  
My long run on Sunday was WET! I postponed it because it was unseasonably cool out and I was hoping that the rain would ease up a bit before I headed out.   
  
Wrong.  
  
It just kept coming down.   
  
Instead of running 8 miles inside on the treadmill I ventured outside prepared to dread my entire run but hoping that it wouldn't be as bad as I thought it would be.  
  
Unfortunately, it was pretty bad.  
  
I had to switch my route at one point because the sidewalks were completely flooded.   
  
The new route that I picked was better but not great. I still spent way too much time and effort into dodging puddles and running through muddy grass to avoid sidewalks flooded out by water.

I learned today that my headphones don't work well when they get wet. They slipped out of my ears all the time and I was constantly readjusting them. Finally, I gave up, took them off and stored them in my hydration pack.  
  
I was cold and couldn't have been more wet if I was aqua jogging. I'm sure people thought that I was crazy as they were driving by.  
  
I only saw one other runner while I was out. This is very unusual and it made me feel a little like a BAMR!  
  
I will say that I was never bored during this run. The run took longer but it seemed shorter because I was distracted by all the challenges the rain gave me.  
  
And in the end when I took my waterlogged shoes off I figured I would have blisters all over my feet. But, amazingly, NO BLISTERS!

The only way that I got through my run was by telling myself over and over that this is good preparation for a rainy race day. A few things I did made this run go as smoothly as it could.

- Wear Body Glide.
- If you have a phone put it in a baggie.
- Wear clothes that you would normally wear for the temperature. Don't add layers because of the rain. 
- Leave the headphones at home. (I learned this one yesterday!)
