Strangely, this week most of my running was done in the evening. I switched around some of my running days to make my schedule work but I still was able to fit in 5 days.  
  
One way that I fit in an unexpected workout was to run while my son had his gymnastics class. I ran around the track and watched his class from above.

My Y workout was supposed to be a tempo and for some reason it is very easy to run faster on the track. Those miles flew by. I kept track of the laps with my lap counter and had my Nike+ app recording the workout too.  
  
We like to make an evening of our Y visit. Little A has her dance class, then they get to climb on the rock wall and we end with gymnastics.  
  
This week I also earned a fun Nike+ badge. At least it made me smile.

Although I'm not exactly sure how they get 9 months. Little E just turned 8 months old and I took a few weeks off to recovery from delivery after she was born. Hmmm...
