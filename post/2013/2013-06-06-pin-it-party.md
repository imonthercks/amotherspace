Today I'm celebrating with Lindsay at [The Lean Green Bean](http://bit.ly/11hLS2o)! She's hosting a Pin It Party. Click over to her blog and join in on the fun.

  
  

Here are a few of my favorites from [**A Mother's Pace**](http://bit.ly/12vkIru):

  

  
[**Squeezing in Exercise with 3 Small Children**](http://bit.ly/11hL25H). 

  
It's always challenging trying to find ways to squeeze in exercise whether you are a stay-at-home mom or a working mom.

[**Music vs. Podcasts for Running Entertainment**](http://bit.ly/10XvTWx)  
  
What do you like to listen to while running? I'm torn between music and podcasts right now.

**[Why is Running So Popular](http://bit.ly/ZtOxtb)**  
  
The popularity of running has greatly increased in recent years. I have a few reasons on my post but I know there are a lot more. Why do you think there are more and more runners out there?

**[Find Your Why](http://bit.ly/12mmCPI)**.   
  
I have several special reasons to run. Why do you run?

**[To Stretch or Not to Stretch?](http://bit.ly/12mmyzJ)**   
  
Everyone seems to think something different about stretching. What works for you? Do you stretch?
