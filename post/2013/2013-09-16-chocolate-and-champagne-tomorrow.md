As much as I wanted to get a race recap from my See Jane Run half marathon over the weekend out today, it didn't happen. Look for it tomorrow! I will say that the course was beautiful and running was fun. _And_ there was chocolate and champagne at the finish. Can't beat a finish like that!

My last week in training was not the best. I completed all the miles on my training plan but I had some unexpected ankle pain. I don't remember hurting it and it could have been a million things but I was not happy that it was hurting. In fact, even when I woke up on Saturday I wasn't sure how I would be feeling on race day.   
  
Luckily for me though, I woke up to no pain and it hasn't hurt since. Weird. Made up mental taper pain???

Staying at home with kids sounds easy, right? Life with 3 little ones is busier than I imagined. I don't write every day on the blog but I do update Facebook, Twitter and Instagram more often.
