Last week was one of my worst workout weeks in a long time. And it came right after a great week too! I just felt off. My back has started aching a lot during this pregnancy, I couldn't find my belly band one morning and my alarm didn't go off on another morning. Excuses, excuses, I know, but that was my week. Two 1.5 mile sessions on the treadmill and one measly 8 minute strength training session.   
  
I also forgot I was huge and pregnant and sprinted toward my daughter after she fell on Saturday. She was o.k. and just has a pretty good bruise on her forehead. My belly and back have been aching a little since that unexpected movement but I'm hoping that doesn't get in the way of walking this week.  
  
My book club got together this week and I actually finished the book this month. We read "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn. It was quite a disturbing book and I was worried that I wouldn't get it finished but then about half way through the book there were some pretty good twists and it was difficult to put it down after that.  
  
Now I am concentrating on catching up with my January New Yorkers.

Lately Before January I was pretty good about keeping up with current issues each week but  I guess January was rough on my magazine reading. I'm not even going to show you the pile of past New Yorkers that is in a basket by my bed. One day I'll catch up!  
  
My doctor appointment went well again this week. I am now on the weekly visits which means one thing...I'm getting closer! I'm pretty lucky because my husband works from home. This makes me pretty lucky in a lot of ways but it has helped me to take advantage of the kids' nap time for my pregnancy appointments. I have made most of my appointments during their nap time and so far it has worked well to sneak out while they are sleeping. Little O typically wakes up before I get home and he knows to go down to the playroom near my husbands office if I'm not home yet. My husband just keeps the monitor downstairs so he can hear when the kids wake up and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it keeps working well for the next four or so appointments.  
  
36 weeks pregnant on Thursday!
