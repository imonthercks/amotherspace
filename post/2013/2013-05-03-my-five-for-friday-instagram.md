I'm having a lot of fun on Instagram lately. I'm relatively new to it but I'm loving seeing what other people put out there. My Five for Friday this week is full of all things [**Instagram**](http://instagram.com/amotherspace).  

  

  

1\. Little A's first dentist appointment and O's second. They were both troopers and did a wonderful job!

2\. Fun at our Move & Groove class. Little E enjoys it just as much as the two older kiddos.

3\. All decked out and ready to help Daddy build the new playground in our backyard.

4\. I was able to squeeze in a run on a beautiful afternoon while my husband and his crew worked on the playground.

5\. The kids were on the swings even before the rest of the playground was finished. They were (and still are) giddy with excitement!

Bonus: I have to have an extra one today. I couldn't leave out my nap time picture. All 3 napping at one time! It doesn't happen every day for very long but it's wonderful when it does happen.
