I'm so glad that I saw this in Runner's World magazine this month. The closer I get to the end of this pregnancy, the more excited I get about running again. (6 weeks left!) I haveÂ had goals of trying to PR in my half marathon this Fall but I've reevaluated. After taking possibly 5 to 6 months off of running (because of the pregnancy) I know I'm not going to get back into running right where I left off. Realistically I might not be at a place to PR and so I am adapting the goal to stay healthy while running instead of trying to run faster. Seeing this in print helps so much!

I also learned a lot from Kim Conley's advice on speedwork. She suggests making the recovery time shorter between the speed intervals. I can really see how that could give confidence on keeping a certain pace for a longer period of time on race day. Eventually, when I get back into speedwork, I'm going to try this out.   
  
Runner's World also had a lot of information on treadmill running this month. Not surprising at all considering that it is the February issue and so many people are heading indoors to avoid the cold. Because we just bought a treadmill, it is good timing for me and I've dogeared a bunch of articles to reread. I'll read them again before taking advantage of running on my treadmill during nap time. That is assuming all three (3!) of my children will nap at the same time!  
  
Now I'm ready for the March issue in my mailbox.
