Yes, it finally happened. The sun came out and the rain clouds went away. The humidity went down to the low 70's (which is a big improvement when it's been in the high 90's!) and I was able to enjoy all this while running. In the evening. In August. Amazing!  
  
I was so thankful that I decided to skip my morning run on Friday when I heard the thunderstorm happening. I figured that the treadmill would still be there after work and I could get a little extra sleep. But, surprisingly, by 5:00 in the evening the weather outside was perfect for running and I had one of my most comfortable postpartum runs yet!  
  
Saturday I finally bought a helmet and so I headed out with the kids for a quick spin around our neighborhood. We biked for almost 5 miles and the kids loved it. It's been too long since we've been out together.

Little O was quite a talker during the ride too. At one point. He said, "This bike is like a race car!" Yep, 3 year olds are fun! HaHa!  
  
Sunday was my long run day. I'm finally in double digits again. 10 miles was fun except for the part that I missed a few spots when I applied body glide. It was so humid here that, OUCH, it made the chaffing pretty bad.   
  
10 miles means that I made it all the way to the park and got to run around inside the park a little before heading home on my out and back.

This path almost looks like fall already.   
  
Little E is now five months and a few weeks old.

It's SUCH a fun month. There are so many milestones happening. Two bottom teeth came in this week. She says "Mamamama" and she is almost sitting up all by herself.

Oh, and I can't leave without wishing my husband a happy birthday. He's a fabulous husband, a wonderful daddy, a hard worker and a newbie runner. I couldn't have asked for a better partner in life and I consider myself blessed to be by his side every day. Yikes, I'm getting mushy...better go. :)  

  

**Do you cross train? If so, do you do something fun like biking or are you more serious and 'cycle?'**

Staying at home with kids sounds easy, right? Life with 3 little ones is busier than I imagined. I don't write every day on the blog but I do update Facebook, Twitter and Instagram more often.
