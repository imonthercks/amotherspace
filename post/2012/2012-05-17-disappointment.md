I had a Girls on the Run race on my schedule for last weekend. Unfortunately, I was SICK on Friday. I barely got out of bed or ate anything the entire day. Very unlike me. I decided late Friday night that it probably wouldn't be a good idea to get up and try and race a 5K the next morning. I wanted to run so badly. It's a fun race and I was really looking forward to it. I decided to stay home vs. take the chance of fainting on the course.

  

I was bummed. It took me a couple of days to get over it. Silly, I know. The best way I know to get over missing a race is to sign up for a few more! The Girls on the Run was going to be my last race for the season. I _was_ going to move into my maintenance training stage to build up my base for the next unknown training cycle. 

  

Now I've signed up for two additional 5K's and a 10K. The 10K is in a couple of weeks and I am planning my training for now around that. It means I have speed work on the calendar again and I'm bumping my weekly miles up to assure I'm ready for it. 

  

Yesterday I went for my first 'longish' run early in the morning before my husband and kids are up. Usually I just do 3-4 miles this early but I decided to go for 5.5 miles. This means heading out of my neighborhood and dealing with traffic a little. I love that it is light outside at 6:00 and I don't have to worry about the cars not seeing me in the dark. I ran down a new street and loved it....can't wait to run on it again. 

  

Distance: 5.5 miles

Time: 54:46

Average Pace: 9:57
