Making real food for my family requires a little bit of planning. I'm used to it because I've been planning weekly meals for years now. I have a weekly notepad on the refrigerator that I fill out before the weekly grocery store trip. It isn't that big of a step for me to look ahead at a recipe and know what needs to be done a day or two before to pull the meal together on time.   
  
  
For example, this week I knew that I wanted to use homemade BBQ sauce instead of store bought so on my planner I wrote 'make BBQ sauce' on Monday's square. The recipe made a lot more than we needed so the extra goes into the freezer ready to be defrosted the next time we want to have BBQ sauce. I also use the notepad to remind myself to take meat or other items out of the freezer to defrost, when to make marinara sauce, tortillas or any other added homemade item to help round out a meal. I've also found that it is easier to plan out two weeks in advance.

I have also learned that even though I have a meal plan I need to be flexible. For the week below I had planned Cabbage Rolls for dinner on Thursday night. We ended up having so many leftovers during the week that I went ahead and made it but instead of serving it for dinner I stuck it in the freezer for later. We had the Senate Soup a lot this week. It was really good and no one minded having it for several meals. (Little O LOVES ham!) When I made it I doubled the recipe and ended up freezing 5 big baggies of it for lunches or dinners later on.
