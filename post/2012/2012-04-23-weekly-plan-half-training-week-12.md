This is it! The final week of training is here and I am ready for the half on Sunday! Because it is the last week I am tapering to give my legs a little bit of a rest before race day.  
  
  
Last week I had to juggle things around a little bit but I was still able to fit my long run in. Here's a look at week 11:

I look at the miles for week 12 and I want to run more! I'm not ready for the training cycle to be over...even though I am excited and ready for the race. I'll follow the training schedule though so that my legs are completely ready for the weekend. Here's what's in store for me this week:

  

Monday: Strength

Tuesday: 4 miles easy (10:24-10:54)

Wednesday: 2 miles pace (9:00-9:23)

Thursday: 2 miles easy (10:24-10:54)

Saturday: Rest

Sunday: RACE DAY! 13.1!
