Last weekend we went to the Farmer's Market for the first time this season. We took the kids and enjoyed walking around and looking at all the fresh produce, bakery items, crafts, plants and of course people watching. We always do one loop through to scope things out and then on our way back around we decide what we will purchase. This week we bought kale, asparagus, lettuce, turnips and a beautiful lantana plant for our side garden. The asparagus was amazing! C.J. sauteed it and we ate it with the original French Dip dinner. I love when asparagus is in season. It's fun to set a meal plan up the afternoon after going to a Farmer's Market...dreaming up different ideas for all of the 'finds' at the market. Our new routine might just have to include the Saturday morning Farmer's Market visit followed by Saturday afternoon meal planning and then finished with grocery shopping for the rest of the weekly supplies on Sunday.
