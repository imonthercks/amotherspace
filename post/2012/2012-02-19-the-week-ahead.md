My five mile 'long' run yesterday was fantastic! I was running a little fast for a long run (my goal pace was between 10:12 and 11:12) but I felt great so I kept at it. I held the pace for the whole run and felt like I could have kept going. I love it when everything clicks in a run...I only wish it happened more often!  
  
Distance: 5 Miles  
Time: 50:14  
Pace: 10:01  
  
I met all my goals for last week and somehow I managed to run during the day EVERY SINGLE DAY! I love it! I won't be so lucky this week and with sick kiddos keeping my husband and I up at night it will be interesting to see what I accomplish this week.  
  
Here is the plan:  
  
Monday/Tuesday: 3.5 Mi Easy Pace, Strength  
Wednesday: 4 Mi including 6x400  
Thursday: 3 Mi Easy Pace  
Friday: Strength  
Saturday: 6 Mi Long Pace  
Sunday: 2-3 Mi Recovery Pace or Cross
