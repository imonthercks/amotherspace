My training for the last 12 weeks is over. I don't have another big race planned for the near future (other than a 5K here and there.) What now? That's a good question. 

  

Coach Jenny from [runnersworld.com](http://askcoachjenny.runnersworld.com/2009/08/recovery-plan-post-half-marathon.html) says:

  

You'll maintain your running fitness for the next round of half-marathon training by running three or four times per week for a total of 15 to 20 miles per week. A typical maintenance training week might look like this:

- Alternate long runs once per week (6 miles, 7 miles, 8 miles, 6 miles)
- One or two easy runs of 4 to 5 miles
- A moderate-to-fast run of 4 to 5 miles (f[artlek](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-263--12081-0,00.html), [tempo](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-263-265-12224-0,00.html), negative split)
- Easy to moderate cross-training
- Strength training twice per week, either on cross-training days or after easy runs

  

I like this plan and I think I'll try and stick to it to maintain my fitness base. Before I read this info I really didn't know how to handle long runs and maintenance running. How much was too much? Do I continue with double digit runs? If I do, will the higher mileage eventually make me burn out? Coach Jenny's plan answered some of my questions. I like the rotation from 6 through 8 although I may add in a little higher mileage every now and again to challenge myself.

  

Looking ahead to my next 5K in two weeks is a little tricky for me. Coach Jenny suggests taking a week off from running after a race. I want to take a recovery week after my half on Sunday...my quads are screaming a little sore from the race and I don't want to push them too hard too quickly. I also want to be ready to race the upcoming 5K. So I'm going to mesh two plans again for the next two weeks. Hal Higdon's [Intermediate 5K training](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/50934/5K-Intermediate-Training-Program) and Coach Jenny's advice from above. 

  

Here are my goals for this week (week 1 of 5K training???)

  

Monday: Recovery bike ride

Tuesday: Rest and Strength (maybe some leg work but mostly upper body)

Wednesday: Easy Jog (no set pace or distance...just whatever feels good)

Thursday: 2-3 miles Easy (depending on how my legs feel after Wednesday)

Friday: Strength

Saturday: 5-7 miles Long

Sunday: 2-3 miles Easy or a Cross Train Bike Ride

  

I am not going to push it at all this week. If I'm out for a run and it doesn't feel right I'm going to bail. Typically after a long race (a half or full) I've just stopped running for awhile. I lost all my gained fitness and had to start over at the beginning during the next training cycle. I DON'T want to do that at all but I also don't want to stress my legs out too much with continued training. I'm hoping to find the balance this time around.
