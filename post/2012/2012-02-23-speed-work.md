Yesterday was my second attempt at speed work on the inside track at the Y. Two weeks ago I tried speed work at the [track](http://momoutforarun.blogspot.com/2012_02_01_archive.html#8226826931433224876) for the first time and it didn't go so well...electronically speaking. This week I set out and made sure that my shoe pod was up and running so that it would \*work\* at the track. I counted laps and watched the time just to make sure that it recorded the workout accurately. Unfortunately it was completely off so I won't be using the Y or anything else indoors for speed work if I want accuracy. This is very disappointing for me because the shoe pod was one of the main reasons why I decided to go with the Nike+ system. There is no way to calibrate it on your own because the directions say to run outside for at least a half mile to calibrate with the GPS signal. I've been running with it for the last week to make sure that it was calibrated and it obviously doesn't work. Of course, I found out after my purchase that Garmin makes a shoe pod as well...  
  
  
My run was GREAT though! My plan was to run 6x400 and then even it out to run 4 miles total with warm up and cool down. According to my Runner's World log I averaged a 9:38 pace. I am getting faster!!! On the track 400 meters is just over two laps. Because my watch wasn't working correctly it told me that 400 meters was 3 laps. I decided to run with the watch so I wouldn't have to keep track of the distance and I could concentrate on running. That means I ran further than 400 meters at a quicker pace.  
  
  
Next time I will drive to a park when I have speed work so that I can get accurate results outside and not worry about stop signs, stop lights and cars while I am trying to keep a certain pace.  
  
Today I have 3 miles scheduled but I am taking the day off. My head is throbbing and my throat is on fire. I'm hoping that with a little rest today (ha....ha...rest with two children 2 and under!?!?!) I will be able to run tomorrow morning and just swap rest days.  
  
Distance: 4 Miles
