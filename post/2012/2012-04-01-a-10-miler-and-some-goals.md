Today (Well, yesterday, really. I didn't get the post finished on Saturday.) was my first double digit run in awhile. I like long runs and I was excited to get back up to 10 again. C.J. dropped me off at the park so I could run 6 miles there and then the 4 back to our house. I loved the route (mostly...see below) and it made the entire run fly by. 

  

Only a couple of hiccups along the way...

- There was a walk scheduled in the park and some people were driving a golf cart to set up signs along the path. I was the unlucky one who got to run by them several times (and smell the fuel from their cart!) Every time they would stop and get out to put a sign in the ground I would run ahead and then in a few minutes they would pass me. We did this for about a mile and it wasn't very pleasant. But I finally got away from them!
- To avoid some road construction I went down a busy street that I have never ran on before and there was no sidewalk. Driving by, I had never noticed the lack of sidewalk before. I didn't want to backtrack to the stop light and it was too busy to jaywalk. I ran in the lumpy grass for a little bit, then through a couple of parking lots and finally found some nice gravely sand by the road to run on. I won't be taking this route again! The gravely sand did make me want to try trail running a little bit. I've never really thought much about that before but it felt good on my legs.
- I saw a fire station up ahead and so I drank almost all of my hand held water thinking that I could duck in there and fill up with a water fountain like I had done with the Team in Training runs last Fall. Â I should have checked to make sure this would work before nearly draining my water...there was no drinking fountain at this particular station! I was a little over 3 miles from home and I ended up making it without having to stop at a gas station and refill. I was very thirsty when I got home though. 

My favorite smell from the run was a ginormous lilac bush. I LOVE lilacs and I'm really missing our two bushes this spring since we moved into a new house. I'm adding that to our landscaping plans...

  

Distance: 10.1 miles

Time: 1:49:20

Average Pace: 10:49

  

Here is a look back at some of my stats from March. I wish I would have known I was so close to 100 miles...I would have tried to add a few in (somewhere!) to go for the triple digits!

  

Miles: 94.7

Total Runs: 20

Strength: 11 times

Long Runs: 4

Tempo Runs: 2

Interval Runs: 2

Runs with an avg. pace between 8:51 and 9:45: 6

  

Here were my March goals:

  

Run 75 miles 

Run 5 9:50/mile avg. runs before Mar. 28th

Strength training 3 times a week

  

I met and exceeded all of these except for the strength training. I kept up with the weights for the whole month until the last week and then I skipped a day. :( So close...

  

Goals for April:

  

Run 85 miles

Run 10K Race under 56:29 (9:05 pace)

Run Half Marathon under 2:05:42 (9:36 pace)

Strength Training 3 times a week

  

These goals make me a little nervous, especially the two races, but I'm going to put in the hard work this month and see what happens!
