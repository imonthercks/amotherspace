Waking up early to do a morning run after speed work in the evening last night was a little challenging. It took me a little while to get into the run this morning (about a mile) but after I did it felt good. I'm trying to pace my 'easy runs' between 10'12" and 10'42" and my pace was 10'56" this morning. I am getting closer!  
  
I've already noticed that my legs are a little sore today. It's just a little harder to get down on the floor to change a diaper! I'll do some easy stretches throughout the day and stay active with the little ones and that should help me to feel better.  
  
Time: 33:25  
Distance: 3.06  
Pace: 10:54
