Happy National Running Day! What better day than a running holiday to take a few minutes to think about why I run. 

  

I run....

- to be happy
- to be healthy
- to have energy
- to be a better mom
- for enjoyment
- for a challenge
- for my 'me' time
- because others can't
- to raise money for important charities

I'm sure if I would take more than a couple of minutes to think about this the list would grow. Running has added so much to my life. I feel blessed that I am able to run and (most mornings) I look forward to heading out and hitting the pavement. 

  

Even on those days that I'm struggling to find the motivation to get out of bed, I never regret the run once I am out there. 

  

This morning was one of those days that I popped out of bed when my alarm went off at 5:30. I was a little surprised because I had basically been awake with A since 4:30. I could have talked myself into trying to get some rest for another hour but instead I laced up my shoes. 

  

It was a great run. 5 nice and easy miles, a light breeze, 66 degrees. Running makes me happy. What a great way to start the day!

  

Distance: 5 miles

Time: 50:27

Seeing my family as I was about to finish my first marathon was definitely one of my happiest moments.
