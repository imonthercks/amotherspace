 My recovery jog this week was a new experience...running on gravel roads.

 I liked it. It had a nice bounce to it that I'm not used to when I typically run on the street or a sidewalk. I just had to watch out for the big rocks.

 It was a nice and easy two miles. I ran by fields,

 up a couple of rolling hills

And I was welcomed home by Mika....she just wishes that she could have gone with me!
