I may have discovered the perfect recipe for running during pregnancy.  
  
1\. Go to sleep at 8:30 P.M.  
  
2\. Sleep a total of 9 hours. (with breaks in between for tossing and turning and the bathroom)  
3\. Wake up at 5:30 A.M. feeling awake and refreshed.   
  
4\. Dress for 35 chilly degrees and head outside to start the day out right.  
  
True, I didn't get anything accomplished last night after the kids went to sleep. I forgot to put the beans out to soak overnight. Luckily we have leftovers for dinner tonight! And I'm sure I could have found something that needed to be cleaned or organized. But at 8:30 I was exhausted and ready for bed.  
My run this morning wasn't pretty. It wasn't fast. It wasn't long. But it was a run and it gave me energy and felt wonderful.   
  
All that, and now I have 3 points for the day!
