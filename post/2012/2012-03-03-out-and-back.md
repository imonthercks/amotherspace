I have missed long runs! Today's 7 miles felt like the first true long run I've had since marathon training last fall. Of course, 7 miles really isn't that long but the build up each week is exciting. Next week is my favorite distance...8 miles!Â 

  

Since we have moved into our new house I have been doing any run longer than 5 miles going out and back on one street. I have never really done this by myself before because I usually plan routes looping around the neighborhood or area that I am running in. I am a convert to the out and back running route! I loved thinking today that I only had to run 3.5 miles and then turn around. I know it is the same distance but mentally this is so much easier. I am also getting closer to my old neighborhood so when I finally make it there it will be fun to run on those streets again. That is probably the biggest thing I miss about moving...my old running routes.

  

The wind was crazy out there today. I knew I was in for a challenge with the wind to my back as I headed out. My goal pace (for training purposes) was between 10:12 and 11:12 for the long run today. Lately I have been running my long runs at a 10:00/mile pace so I really had to think about slowing it down just a little. I started out fast and in the end I kicked it a little harder but overall I'm really happy with my average pace of 10:19. Here are my splits:
