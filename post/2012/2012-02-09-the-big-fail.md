My speed workout this evening with my Nike+ was a big FAIL! I was all excited to begin my first speed work session, I had a babysitter (thanks, Mom!) and then I got to the gym only to find the battery for my Nike shoe system had died. I was tempted to just jog the 3 miles but I decided to go for it anyway. I mean, I'm not running for the watch...I'm running for me. I really wanted a baseline from my first workout but it didn't happen this week.  
  
After walking several laps to try and get my watch going I started my workout. (5x400m) I know that I was running slower towards the end of the workout but it felt great to run really fast (for me) and I could tell that I was getting a great cardio workout. I added a few more laps to round out the run to be 3 miles even so I knew exactly what distance I completed. I know I finished pretty quickly but I was so upset about the watch not working that I forgot to look at the clock on the wall before I started! I know it was under 30 minutes but by how much, I'm not sure. In two weeks I'll try it again and this time I'll double check the battery before I leave the house!
