###### I can't offer you a formula. For one thing, you would have to weigh your kids before each run to determine how much you're pushing. Instead of miles, think time. So if your push-run lasts 30 minutes consider it the equal of a regular run at about the same intensity.

My run yesterday was only for 21 minutes so I guess I should have stuck with it for another 9 minutes or so to complete my daily goal. It's an interesting idea though so next time I will try and run slower so that I can handle the pace for a little longer.
