It turns out that tortillas are very easy to make! The only (minor) setback was a smoke filled house causing the very loud smoke alarm to go off. I started off with the heat too high on the pan and it made a lot of smoke! Overall everything was much easier than I anticipated. They are delicious too! Both O & A have enjoyed them for a snack this week.   
  
  
This week I also made a batch of granola\*, Wheatberry and Quinoa Salad, and a big batch of dried black beans for the freezer.  
  
  
The Cabbage Rolls turned out o.k. but were lacking in flavor. I love the idea of Cabbage Rolls but in the future I would make them with a different meat...like Italian Sausage to give it a little more taste. We are adding cheese to the leftovers to make it work a little better for us. Also, the flavors had more time to mix together when we ate them as leftovers and they were much better the second time around.
