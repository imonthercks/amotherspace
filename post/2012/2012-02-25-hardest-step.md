This afternoon I was helping my two year old son fall asleep and all I wanted to do was snuggle in beside him but I kept thinking of the quote above. I was trying to stay motivated when all my tired body (huge lack a sleep because of a teething daughter) wanted to do was take a NAP. I knew that once I was running I would feel better and I would come home afterwards and have more energy to be with my kids and my husband.  
  
That said, it is WINDY here today and I really think that all my steps were pretty tough today and not just the first one out the door! I'm so glad I went though. Today was my long run day and my plan says to do 6 miles. I did it in just over 1 hour. The last time I did 6 miles was in September and it took me an hour and ten minutes so I'm pretty happy with the improvement.  
  
What amazed me about this run was that I ran it very steady. I really watched my pace throughout the run and tried to keep it right at 10 minutes per mile. The last half mile was up two hills and straight into the strong wind. I really pushed it hard and even though my pace didn't improve it didn't go down either. I was either going to keep my pace or break down and walk it...I'm glad I chose to give it my all and RUN.
