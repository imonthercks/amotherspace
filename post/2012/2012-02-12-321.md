Today I made some No bake Energy Bites (Found on Pinterest, of course) that I am going to try out before my runs this week. I figure it is much healthier than the peanut butter crackers I have been eating before an early morning run.  
  
Here is my plan for this week.  
  
Monday/Tuesday: 3 miles/Strength Training  
Wednesday: 3 miles pace  
Thursday: 3 miles  
Friday: Strength Training  
Saturday: 5 miles  
Sunday: 2-3 miles or Cross  
  
I am hoping to set out for my recovery jog today after my little O goes to sleep...
