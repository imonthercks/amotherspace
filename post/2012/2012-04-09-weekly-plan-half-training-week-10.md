Last week I ended up taking the easy route for most of the week. That's the problem with giving myself choices for various workouts I guess. Some things were out of my control...like the weather and deciding to spend time with family instead of running on a holiday. I still had a good week so I'm o.k. with taking a little bit of a break...at least that is what I'm telling myself!  
  
  
One good thing about last week...I ran my 200th mile of 2012!
