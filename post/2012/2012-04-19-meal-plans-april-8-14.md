When I first started writing this blog I wanted to use it as a place to log my training and running patterns. I meant it mainly for my use and anyone else who seemed to find it interesting. I wanted to be able to look back at what I had done during my training so that I could modify it (or keep it the same, if it worked) for the next training cycle. I also wanted to include some personal activities and events that my family does so that I can look back and remember what life was like at this stage.   
  
  
Soon after the blog began I started to learn more and more about how bad processed foods are for our bodies. I thought that we ate a pretty healthy diet but when I actually looked in my pantry and at my meal plans for the past several months I realized just how much processed food we eat. The more I read on the subject the more I realized that I wanted to make a big change with the types of food that we buy and eat at our house. Luckily, my husband is very supportive of this and helps me a lot as we take our weekly steps towards becoming free of processed foods.  
  
  
I began to use the blog to document some of our changes...it's where the 'Healthy' part of Mom on the Run comes into play. I can compile recipes and ideas of what has and hasn't worked for us on this journey.   
  
  
I've been wanting to share my meal plans for awhile now. It's a great way for me to look back and see what we ate to get ideas for future meals and maybe others will get ideas for healthy meal options as well. You will see from the plans that we are not 100% committed to the Real Food/No Processed Foods way of thinking. We do occasionally eat processed foods but we are trying to cut them out as much as possible.  
  
  
Lastly, I am NOT a food blogger. I'm not a creative cook. I'm just a wife and a mother trying to make a difference in our nutrition. I heavily rely on recipes to make our meals and rarely do I ever just throw something together. Therefore, most of my recipes come from cook books or online, either from web pages or other blogs that I have found. Click on the links below if you find something that looks interesting and it will take you to the recipe if one is available.
