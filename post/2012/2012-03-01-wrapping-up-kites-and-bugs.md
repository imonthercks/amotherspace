February felt great! I love running regularly again and I'm so glad that I set my half marathon goal for April. Here is a look back at February:

  

Miles: 64.1

Total Runs: 19

Strength: 7 times

Long Runs: 4

Tempo Runs: 2

Interval Runs: 2

  

I have bumped up my training a little a lot (thinking about it I doubled my January miles...that's a lot for sure!) and I am feeling great. Over the next few months I want to increase mileage (of course) and strength training. With just one month of speed work my times are already improving. I'm excited to see where I go from here. 

  

My goals for March include:

  

Run 75 miles (actually between Feb. 27 & Mar. 27th)

Run 5 9:50/mile avg. runs before Mar. 28th

Strength training 3 times a week

  

Another goal that I am working on is to prepare more real food for myself and my family. I want to cut out processed foods and eat more healthy foods. There I said it...it's official! This is a scary step for me because it is a time and monetary investment to eat better food. I am taking baby steps and I'll start posting some things I am trying along the way on my blog so I can keep track of what works for us.

  

My tempo run today went o.k. I am happy with my overall pace of 9:40 but I had wanted to keep it between 8:49 and 9:12. Ha! I did my first run under 9:50 for my March goal, so that's good. Just because I want to run my half at 2 hours doesn't mean I am going to make it this time around. Right now I am running at a pace to complete the half marathon in 2 hours and 10 minutes. That's realistically what my goal should be for the race in April. It takes 6 minutes off my PR so that would be **great**!

  

Thoughts about running today:

\-My left calf was tight. I need to watch that.

\-I almost got hit by a kite today. twice.

\-I hate swallowing bugs while running. Really I hate swallowing bugs anytime.
