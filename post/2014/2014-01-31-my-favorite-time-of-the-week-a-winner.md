Friday is finally here! I say that, but strangely, this week seemed to go by pretty quickly. I'm always happy to see a Friday though!  
  
This week I've rounded up a few random thoughts for you for my Friday Five. Happy Friday!

The winner of the ENERGYbits sample is Nancy D! Congrats, Nancy. I've sent you an email and I've also forwarded your email on to the ENERGYbits crew.

Yesterday my pinning finger got quite a workout. Lindsay over at the [Lean Green Bean](http://www.theleangreenbean.com/pin-it-party-4/) hosted her fourth Pin It Party. I linked up [5 of my favorite posts](http://amotherspace.blogspot.com/2014/01/pin-it-party-4.html#.Uuo4afldVSc) but the real fun happened later. I found so many great recipes, workouts and other tips on so many different pages yesterday and I pinned away. I'm not through the list yet so I'll be back to find more.

One of my favorites times of the week happens when we're at the Y. Not because I'm exercising (honestly, we don't use the Y for grown up exercise much) but because I'm watching my children at dance and gymnastics.

Training for my next half marathon begins on Monday. Because of this I'm debating about my running plans this weekend. 1) Run a short 5 miles to give myself a little break before a tough training cycle starts. 2) Run a race on Sunday for fun. 3) Keep going with my progression and run 6-7 miles to get ready for my 8 miler next weekend. Decisions, decisions...  
  
\[five\]  
The training schedule I mentioned above is my toughest one yet. I'm determined this time around to run under 2 hours and I'm going to do the work to make sure that happens. It scares me a little but it's exciting at the same time.  
  
  

**Did you participate in the Pin It Party? Have you ever made or followed a training plan that scared you?**
