![Halloween 2014 | amotherspace.net](images/IMG_1265-1024x768.jpg) Happy Halloween! I love that cheesy little tongue out kinda smile! We're looking forward to our traditional chicken noodle soup with mashed potatoes for dinner tonight before trick-or-treating . We're trying a new recipe this year though. It's from [Iowa Girl Eats](http://iowagirleats.com/2014/10/22/homemade-chicken-noodle-soup/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IowaGirlEats+%28Iowa+Girl+Eats%29) and looks amazing, not to mention healthy!

## \[three\] Life Lately

Life lately has meant a whole lot of late nights staying up to watch the Royals in the postseason. It's been an exciting few weeks for this Kansas girl (even though I am a Cubbie fan at heart) while the Royals have been battling for the championship. Our boys in blue lost the World Series in game 7 but they gave it their all and had a fantastic season. I'm just excited to get back to a regular sleeping schedule for everyone in our house, including myself!

## \[five\] Weekend Plans

My 5-year-old starts basketball this weekend. I'm sure it will be very entertaining to watch all the kids attempt to dribble the ball and run down the court. I can't wait to see how he likes it! Other than that we have an easy weekend scheduled. I'm ready to get caught up on some things around the house and spend some quality family time together.
