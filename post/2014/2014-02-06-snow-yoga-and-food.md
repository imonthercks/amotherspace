I'm thinking out loud again this week. Here's what's on my mind.  
  
My blog posts have been a little sporadic lately. I'm in the process of working on some blog changes and that behind the scenes work is cutting into my blogging time. (That and the fact that my 11 month old is no longer taking a morning nap!) Big changes are happening soon! I'll keep you posted.   
  
This week we've had two snow days and the official amount of snow in my area was 8.7 inches. Unfortunately, the temps are so cold (windchill below zero) that we haven't gotten out to enjoy the snow yet. Even though the big kids would be fine if they were bundled up, I'm not going to take my baby out in that. So we've stayed inside and warm. I'm sure we'll be out in the snow before it melts.

Some neighborhood boys came by and offered to shovel our driveway for cash. It made my husbands day and it was worth every penny!

I've done yoga twice this week so far! It's something that I really want to incorporate into my fitness schedule but I never end up making time for it. Thanks to the [Move, Nourish, Believe Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/571617342921583/?ref_dashboard_filter=calendar) from Sweat Pink, I tried out a new yoga workout and loved it. Wednesday was my rest day from running but I decided to get out the yoga mat and stretch out a little. I'm very much a beginner at yoga but I'd love to add it to my regular routine.  
  
My two favorite foods right now are eggs and sweet potatoes. Not together, although now that I'm typing that out I'm sure it would be fabulous! I've been eating eggs for breakfast and sometimes lunch, usually fried. Lately, if a recipe has sweet potatoes in it, it catches my eye. Sweet potatoes with chili on top, yes please. Sweet potato tacos, quinoa salad, super bowl dip. I've had them all in the past week or so. And for dinner tonight we are taking some of that [Sweet Potato Dip](http://www.runwiki.org/2013/11/04/sweet-potato-dip/#.UvKaDPldVSe) and making it into enchiladas. YUM!

That's all for now, I'm off to put in more time working behind the scenes!
