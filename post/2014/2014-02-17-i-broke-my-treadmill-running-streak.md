Only the second week into my training plan and I had a horrible week of running. The treadmill was not my friend last week and every mile felt like torture. I didn't accomplish the speed work that I wanted or reach my mileage for the week but then that all turned around on Friday.

Friday was Valentine's Day and I was exhausted and slept through my alarm. That ended up being a great thing for me because instead of running on the treadmill in the morning, I managed to get out late in the afternoon and enjoy an outside run.  
  
When I started up my watch, I noticed that the last date on it was January 25th. The fact that it had been 20 days since I had ran outside is very depressing to me. I'm glad to have broken that indoor running streak!

It was a beautiful run and I enjoyed every second of it.  
  
The next morning I was all set to run my long run of the week. I ended up driving to a local park and running on the paths. There were a lot of runners out and the paths were clear of snow. It was windy and chilly but I was so happy to be outside. I hit my first double digit run of the training cycle!

The plan was for 10 miles with 2 mid miles at race pace. My fifth mile was at an 8:31 pace and my sixth mile at 8:51. At the time I was pretty disappointed because I thought my race pace was 8:30 and I was 20 seconds off. But when I got home I looked it up again and my race pace is actually a little over a 9 minute pace. So I guess I should be pretty happy with the times that I had!  
  
My husband has a vacation day today so I'm planning on running outside yet again.  
  
I'm looking forward to this week and I'm thankful that I get to try again. I'm hoping that my break from the treadmill will make it easier to get back on it this week because I have a lot of miles to cover on it.
