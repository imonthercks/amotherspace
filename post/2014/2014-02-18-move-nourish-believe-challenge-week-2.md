Last week was the second week of the [Move, Nourish Believe Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/571617342921583/) with the Sweat Pink community and [Lorna Jane](http://lornajane.com/). It's three weeks of moving, nourishing and believing to help stay on track with healthy goals for the year.  
  
So I took pictures throughout the week and shared them on Instagram. Are you on Instagram? [**Follow me**](http://instagram.com/amotherspace) and let me know your username below in the comments if I'm not following you already.  
  
**Week Two: Nourish**  
  
**Monday**: Go Meatless

My meatless meals were a little egg heavy on accident. Eggs and toast for breakfast. Leftover sweet potato enchiladas with black bean quinoa salad for lunch and split pea soup with an egg for dinner. Never had an egg in your split pea soup before? Try it!  
  
**Tuesday:** Take your lunch to work today!

As a stay at home mom of three I eat lunch at home 99.9% of the time. On Tuesday I had a turkey and avocado sandwich on some local 3 ingredient bread with apple and cheese slices. I also a frozen yogurt bite from [movenourishbelieve.com](http://movenourishbelieve.com/).   
  
**Wednesday**: Write it down! Journal your food and share your WIAW with us!

I realized that I snack more than I think when I went to write down this list.  A few times during the day I _wanted_ to eat something but I didn't want it to go on the list. It was a satisfying day though and not too far from what my list would be every day.  
  
**Thursday:** Smoothie Day! Happy Thirsty Thursday! Make a healthy smoothie today.

It had been too long since I had made smoothies! I put together a few things that we had on hand and it turned out pretty good. Little E doesn't look very happy in the picture above but that is only because I momentarily stopped giving her smoothie to take a picture. My smoothie included organic vanilla yogurt, frozen spinach, strawberries and blueberries, organic whole milk, and a handful of raw oats.  
  
**Friday:** Go Raw Friday!

I ate plenty of raw food on Friday (carrots, salad, etc.) but the picture I put up on Instagram was of the yogurt bites. I mixed some organic vanilla yogurt with cut up frozen fruit, spooned it onto a cookie sheet and stuck it back in the freezer. It makes a very refreshing snack. We took it to our preschool Valentine's Day party this week too and the kids (and other mom's) loved them!  
  
And that's week two! Week three \[believe\] started on Monday and is the last week of the challenge! To read more about week one \[move\] and my five fitness favorites,
