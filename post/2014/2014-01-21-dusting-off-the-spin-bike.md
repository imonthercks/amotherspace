We have a spin bike in the basement but it hardly gets used at all. My husband, who is the cyclist in our family, has been focusing more on running lately and I've only been on the thing a couple of times since we've owned it.  
  
That is all about to change. On Sunday, which was a rest day from running, I woke up early and went downstairs to try out the bike. I had found this great workout from Lindsay over at [Cotter Crunch](http://www.cottercrunch.com/2014/01/move-it-monday-core-and-more/) and decided to give it a try. She has fantastic tips for spinning and also a couple of links to other spinning sites as well. It was all very helpful for this newbie spinner!  
  
I hopped on the bike for the 5 minute warm up and then got down to work for the climb intervals. These spin bikes are tough!

The workout called for two minute intervals and it really broke up the ride and made it go by quickly. I did this for 10 minutes and then jumped off for the core work. After 3 minutes of core work it was time to get on the bike and do it all over again and then one more time after that.  
  
I finished with a cool down and completely happy that I had just finished a 50 minute cross training workout. I will definitely revisit this workout and happily add spinning to my weekly workouts.  
  
One of the tips that I read recently was to go to a spin class and arrive early. That way you can introduce yourself to the instructor and he or she can fit your bike properly and also help you out with form throughout the class. I'm seriously considering taking a class soon at the YMCA, I just have to talk my husband into going with me. :)  
  
  

**Have you taken a spin class? Do you use a spin bike? What tips do you have for me?**
