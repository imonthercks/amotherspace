The Runner's World Holiday Run Streak officially ended on New Years Day but I kept running. It didn't seem right to end a streak when I was so close to running more consecutive days than the last streak. Last summer I ran 40 days in a row (**[read about it here](http://amotherspace.blogspot.com/2013/07/what-i-learned-from-streaking.html#.UsmaAPRDtSc)**) so this time around I wanted to run at least 41 days.   
  
41 days will be Monday, today, except I'm writing this a day earlier, of course.  
  
This time around the streak was mainly on the treadmill. I'm certain that without a treadmill at home it would have been a lot harder. Not impossible because I could have ran inside at the Y but I know that would have been difficult to accomplish every day.

My most difficult run was just last week. I had a busy day and had to run at night before bed. This was _after_ dinner out for pizza and beer at a local brewery. Not my wisest decision but time spent with visiting family was more important than a quality run on that day!

Run Streak Miles: 117.83 (\*updated to add Monday's mileage for the streak\*)  
1 milers (typical non-running rest days): 11  
  
I'm guessing that Runner's World will have another streak in the summer but I'm planning on sitting that one out. My fall marathon will be my focus at that point.
