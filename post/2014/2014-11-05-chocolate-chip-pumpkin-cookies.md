Every now and again I like to share one of my favorite recipes here on the blog. And this recipe for Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Cookies is too good not to share. It's one of our favorite cookies to bake and yet for some reason we still only make them in the fall.

I baked a double batch last week for Halloween and put a few in the freezer to save for later. They are easy to throw together quickly, make your house smell amazing and are just plain yummy.

In fact they are dangerous and I've been known to eat too many after I bake them. Maybe that is why I only make them once or twice a year...

I'm grateful that my sister-in-law shared her mother-in-law's recipe with us and now I'm passing it along to you!

Enjoy!
