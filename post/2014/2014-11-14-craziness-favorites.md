Can we just talk about how cold it got all of a sudden?

I took my kids to the dentist on Monday afternoon. While we were waiting for the dentist we talked about playing outside when we got home to enjoy the last little bit of warm weather for awhile. When we left not even an hour later I was shocked to see that the temps had dropped 20 degrees. It was only in the 50's at that point but the wind was horrible. I felt awful that I hadn't put jackets on the kids. Needless to say we played inside before dinner instead of outside.

The other crazy environmental thing that happened here in Kansas this week was that we had an earthquake. Yes, you read that right, an earthquake. In Kansas.

You may be surprised to hear that we have them pretty often in the Midwest but this one was different. I've only felt one other earthquake before and that was a couple of months ago. The earthquake on Wednesday was strong (4.8 magnitude!) and lasted quite awhile. I braced myself while I was standing and watched things shake in my house. I even looked out the window to see if something had happened outside (tornado or plane crash???) before I realized that it was an earthquake. Craziness!

And now on to some of my favorites from the week.

**\[one\]** Yoga + Kettlebells with my little monkeys. They always want to participate when they see me exercising! **\[two\]** My happy place, especially when I've been missing my regular routine of running a lot of miles lately. **\[three\]** Bedtime snuggles are the best. **\[four\]** Brrr...it's cold. Coffee tastes even better in the winter. **\[five\]** Library Story Time is one of our favorite activities of the week. I love to watch Little E participate. She dances and sings to all the songs. And Little O is such a good reader and has been picking up some nonfiction lately. He's teaching me all sorts of facts!

## Currently Eating

This week I was searching for a vegetarian slow cooker recipe.We're trying to eat at home more and also cut food costs a little while still buying quality food. All the recipes that looked good in my go-to slow cooker cookbooks have meat in them which brings the $$ up a lot. So I headed over to Pinterest and searched for the perfect recipe. And did I ever find it!

[{Slow Cooker} Mexican Quinoa](http://www.chelseasmessyapron.com/slow-cooker-mexican-quinoa/?utm_content=bufferd6144&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) from Chelsea's Messy Apron was the perfect find. It was filling and has a lot of our favorite ingredients. Black beans, sweet potatoes, and quinoa plus all the spices of a yummy Mexican dish. The only problem was that the kids didn't really like it because it was a little on the spicy side. We served it with quesadillas, a salad and fresh cut veggies so even though they didn't eat the main dish they still had a healthy meal.
