Last week I talked about my extreme [lack of motivation](http://amotherspace.net/2014/11/rolling-stretching-and-icing-motivation-during-a-running-injury/ "Rolling, Stretching and Icing: Motivation During a Running Injury") and I think a lot of it had to do with being frustrated with my [injury](http://amotherspace.net/2014/10/dealing-with-a-running-injury/ "Dealing with a Running Injury"). This week my foot feels better, not 100% yet, but much, much better and my motivation to workout came back.

I'm going on just over a week with no heel pain at all and last Monday, after 2 days of no pain, I decided to try pool running. I wish that I had been doing it all along! We headed to the pool on Monday evening and played in the shallow end for awhile. Then I put on the swim belt and headed to the deep end while my husband continued playing with the kids.

For 20 minutes I watched my family play and I 'ran' in place in the deep end. It wasn't fantastic, I didn't love it but it was a good workout. I should have been doing this all along so that my fitness from the marathon didn't disappear. I'm hoping that we continue to go to the pool on a regular basis throughout the winter and I continue to get some running in this way. It's a great way to cross train and hopefully keep me from injury again.

This week I concentrated on strength (4 workouts) and yoga (3 workouts) with a couple cardio spin workouts and even a couple RUNS! Marathon training left me little time to continue with strength and yoga but now that I'm on my own schedule again I am working it into my plan. _My injury-free plan._ I'm planning a post on Wednesday to talk more about his. Stay tuned!

So I've been easing back into running with a couple of short, easy-paced runs. They felt fantastic both during the run and after. I am amazed how much my legs felt it the day after my first 2 miler. Only 2 miles and I felt it the next day! I guess those 17 days between runs make a huge difference.

During my first run back I kept waiting for the pain to start. I couldn't believe that my foot wasn't hurting at all. My husband had taped it before I left and the added support really helped. I had only planned to run 1 mile but once I was out there and feeling great I just couldn't stop.

Keep reading below to find my weekly workouts from last week.
