Saturday I joined thousands all over the world and ran for Meg. I ran for her husband, her three small children, and her friends and family who lost her too early to a drunk driver.

I ran from my house and out of my neighborhood. Anytime I do this I have to run on a narrow street that doesn't have a shoulder. I HATE running on this street but unless I drive to a different location and park before running I have no other option on a long run. As every car passed me on this short road (about a quarter mile) I thought of Meg.  
  
I thought of how sad it is that she was doing something that she loved when something so horrible happened.   
  
But I did also take the time to be grateful for the moment I was in. To enjoy my surroundings and enjoy doing one of my favorite things, running.

I finished 7 miles for Meg on Saturday. But that's not the last time I'll run for her. She'll be in my thoughts often as I hit the road to log my miles.

The numbers from Nike are way off this week (39 miles in a week? Not me!) but the daily miles in the chart above are pretty accurate.
