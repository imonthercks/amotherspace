It's been a few weeks since I've done a Friday Favorites post. I have a lot of favs right now so I'll jump right in.

## Instagram

\[one\] I recently made the switch from Android to iPhone and I'm loving all the new apps that are now available to me. I've been playing around a little on Instagram lately. Fitsnap is one of my favorites! \[two\] I was recently featured on the Another Mother Runner website in Sarah and Dimity's Follow That Mother series. Read more ---> [here](http://amotherspace.net/2014/09/follow-that-mother/ "Follow That Mother!"). \[three\] I'm running in the early morning still and lately that means I'm seeing some pretty spectacular sunrises. \[four\] It always amazes me when I can run a pace for 7 miles (or more) when sometimes that exact same pace is impossible for 3 miles. \[five\] I've had a few treadmill miles lately and they've been tough. I'm slowly getting used to it again because I'm guessing I'll be on it a lot over the winter.

## Flashback Friday

![Flashback Friday | amotherspace.net](images/I-stumbled-upon-this-oldie-but-goodie-from-my-high-school-cross-country-days.-Its-from-my-one-and-only-time-at-the-State-Championship-and-was-an-awful-but-memorable-race-because-of-my-injury.-tbt.jpg)

I stumbled upon this oldie but goodie recently from my high school cross country days. This particular photo was taken during a state championship and I believe I placed dead last. My injury on my leg was killing me and the only reason I didn't drop out was because our little team of 5 needed everyone to cross the finish line in order to place as a team. Little did I know that one of my other teammates dropped out of the race earlier! I'm glad I finished though. I specifically remember people clapping for me at the finish line and besides being completely embarrassed, I was proud that I finished.

## Favorite Running Gear

![Oiselle Roga | amotherspace.net](images/Oiselle-1024x1024.jpg)

 

Hands down, my favorite running shorts are the [Oiselle Rogas](http://amzn.to/1pEBiBR). (affiliate link) Until buying these I was wearing inexpensive shorts that were for the most part purchased at Target. I had no idea how nice a pair of shorts that actually fit well could be. Ever since I purchased these it's been hard to pull out my old shorts and when I do I'm constantly tugging on them. I don't think the old ones will last much longer in my rotation!

I also purchased the [Winona Tank](http://amzn.to/1pZuRXh) and I'm a big fan of that as well. The fabric is so soft that I almost feel like it shouldn't be a workout shirt!

## Currently Reading

Marathon training is the perfect time to listen to an audio book. I'm currently making my way through The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt. I only listen to it while I'm running so it's a great motivator to get me out the door. I had heard that it was a really good book but I didn't know anything about it before I started listening. Needless to say, I'm hooked.
