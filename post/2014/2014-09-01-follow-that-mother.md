Today I have the honor of being the featured runner on [Another Mother Runner](http://anothermotherrunner.com/2014/08/31/follow-mother-40/)'s series 'Follow This Mother.'

Welcome to all visiting from the Another Mother Runner site!

I've enjoyed Dimity and Sarah's blog for some time now which led me to running with their podcast, reading their books and using their training plans for a few races. Currently I'm following their 'Own It Plan' from "Train Like a Mother" which is helping me to get stronger and ready to run the Chicago Marathon in October.
